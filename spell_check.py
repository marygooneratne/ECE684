# Build from scratch a spelling corrector in Python. It should include:
#   1. tokenization
#   2. edit distance-based non-word spelling correction
#   3. de-tokenization
# As an example use case, consider a version of Jane Austen’s Sense and
# Sensibility (available via nltk’s gutenberg corpus) corrupted by random insertions,
# deletions, and substitutions.
# Constraints:
#   • Your spelling correction function should accept a single string and return
#   a single string.
#   • Your spelling correction module may use only standard libraries and
#   numpy.
#   • To test it you may use the nltk.corpus package.
# You may work in a group of 1 or 2. Submissions will be graded without
# regard for the group size. Submit your solution in a .zip file including a
# Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) demonstrating its usage.
