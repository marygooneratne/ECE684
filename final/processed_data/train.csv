1,"After travelling day and night I arrived with an anxious, yet a hoping heart, for why should he send for me if it were only to avoid me and to treat me with the apparent aversion that he had in London."
1,"Her energy of character induced her still to combat with the ills of life; even those attendant on hopeless love presented themselves, rather in the shape of an adversary to be overcome, than of a victor to whom she must submit."

1,In a moment she was in his arms.
1,She would sit apart from us and watch him; she would weep for joy to think that he was hers.
1,He lived for some time never looking on the light of heaven but shrouding his eyes in a perpetual darkness far from all that could remind him of what he had been; but as time softened his grief like a true child of Nature he sought in the enjoyment of her beauties for a consolation in his unhappiness.
1,"With a beating heart she expected another visit, and when after an interval her chamber was again invaded, having first assured herself that the intruders were her mother and an attendant, she composed herself to feigned sleep."

1,"""Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief."
1,"From him she sprung, flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone and not, as heretofore, are you content to trace in her downy cheek and delicate limbs, an affinity to Raymond, but in her enthusiastic affections, in the sweet qualities of her mind, you may still find him living, the good, the great, the beloved."

1,"She made it her task to attend the sick, comfort the sorrowing, assist the aged, and partake the sports and awaken the gaiety of the young."
1,The political state of England became agitated as the time drew near when the new Protector was to be elected.
1,"I believe it was that coming out with a determination not to be repulsed I went right forward to my object without well weighing his replies: I was led by passion and drew him with frantic heedlessness into the abyss that he so fearfully avoided I replied to his terrific words: ""You fill me with affright it is true, dearest father, but you only confirm my resolution to put an end to this state of doubt."

1,"Know that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate."
1,"What is it you fear?"" ""Oh Peace, peace, my love,"" replied I; ""this night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful."""
1,"Heaven shower down blessings on you, and save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness."
1,"After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey, and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my return, have restored me entirely to myself."
1,"Oh I must not be mad when I see him; or perhaps it were as well that I should be, my distraction might calm his, and recall him to the endurance of life."
1,"Heretofore we have been friends lovers let us not become enemies, mutual spies."

1,"As I could not pass through the town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais."
1,"""How inconstant are your feelings But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?"

1,"The visionary Perdita beheld in all this only a new gloss upon an old reading, and her own was sufficiently inexhaustible to content her."
1,"The plain around was interspersed with cemeteries, Turk, Greek, and Armenian, with their growth of cypress trees; and other woods of more cheerful aspect, diversified the scene."

1,"You will not do this, I know you will not."
1,It was in the newspaper that she saw the advertisement for the design for a national gallery.
1,"Besides, is it not a shame, that the genius of Adrian should fade from the earth like a flower in an untrod mountain path, fruitless?"
1,"The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion."
1,"And the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had not seen for so long a time."
1,"Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to describe gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions."
1,"Her fear had been too deep, too absorbing, too entire, to be changed to security."
1,"Bread and water did not tame my blood, nor solitary confinement inspire me with gentle thoughts."
1,"I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life."
1,"I crept along by the fern, on my hands and knees, seeking the shadowy coverts of the underwood, while the birds awoke with unwelcome song above, and the fresh morning wind, playing among the boughs, made me suspect a footfall at each turn."

1,"He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck."
1,Such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day.
1,"In after sorrow or joy, believe that you father's spirit is near, to save or sympathize with you."
1,"""Yet,"" replied I, ""nature always presents to our eyes the appearance of a patient: while there is an active principle in man which is capable of ruling fortune, and at least of tacking against the gale, till it in some mode conquers it."""
1,But that could not be.
1,"He did not join as usual in the playful spirit of the rest; but, entering into conversation with Adrian and myself, by degrees we seceded from our companions, and Idris and Perdita only remained with the children."
1,"Their only inhabitant, a little girl, was dancing, waltzing, and singing about them, followed by a large Newfoundland dog, who boisterously jumping on her, and interrupting her, made her now scold, now laugh, now throw herself on the carpet to play with him."
1,In the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.
1,"As the country people poured into London, the citizens fled southwards they climbed the higher edifices of the town, fancying that they could discern the smoke and flames the enemy spread around them."
1,"In the morning, on her return, my servant found me almost lifeless, while possessed by a high fever I was lying on the floor of my room."
1,And where does he now exist?
1,"He made few remarks, till, on observing through his glass the sequel of an order he had given, his face, clouded for awhile with doubt, became radiant."
1,"He had a feeling that however they might express ridicule of his intended marriage they would not dare display it when it had taken place; therefore seeking the consent of his guardian which with some difficulty he obtained, and of the father of his mistress which was more easily given, without acquainting any one else of his intention, by the time he had attained his twentieth birthday he had become the husband of Diana."
1,She took me under her protection because she considered it her duty; but she had too long lived alone and undisturbed by the noise and prattle of children to allow that I should disturb her quiet.
1,"His paroxisms of passion were terrific but his soul bore him through them triumphant, though almost destroyed by victory; but the day would finally have been won had not I, foolish and presumtuous wretch hurried him on untill there was no recall, no hope."
1,"She was the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness."
1,Let our affection expire but let it not be exchanged for distrust and recrimination.
1,"I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me."
1,"I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so miserable as I am now."""
1,"Those writers who have imagined a reign of peace and happiness on earth, have generally described a rural country, where each small township was directed by the elders and wise men."
1,"His manner, timid at first, became firm his changeful face was lit up to superhuman brilliancy; his voice, various as music, was like that enchanting."
1,"As Windsor lay, to a great degree, in the line of march from the west, I removed my family to London, assigning the Tower for their sojourn, and joining Adrian, acted as his Lieutenant in the coming struggle."
1,"While I was directing that the necessary care should be taken of her, Clara came in; she was trembling and pale; and, when I anxiously asked her the cause of her agitation, she threw herself into my arms weeping and exclaiming ""Uncle, dearest uncle, do not hate me for ever I must tell you, for you must know, that Evelyn, poor little Evelyn"" her voice was choked by sobs."
1,I do not address them to you alone because it will give me pleasure to dwell upon our friendship in a way that would be needless if you alone read what I shall write.
1,I bestowed on him all my affections; there was a miniature of him that I gazed on continually; I copied his last letter and read it again and again.
1,"Advance avail thyself of the gift, thou and thy comrades; and in the drama you are about to act, do not disgrace those who taught you to enter on the stage, and to pronounce becomingly the parts assigned to you May your progress be uninterrupted and secure; born during the spring tide of the hopes of man, may you lead up the summer to which no winter may succeed See an ingenious Essay, entitled, ""The Mythological Astronomy of the Ancients Demonstrated,"" by Mackey, a shoemaker, of Norwich printed in ."
1,"But a bitter thought swiftly shadowed her joy; she bent her eyes on the ground, endeavouring to master the passion of tears that threatened to overwhelm her."
1,"But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her; and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had promised to reveal to her on the following day."
1,"The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth."
1,"Although they spent much time together at Windsor, the extreme youth of Adrian prevented any suspicion as to the nature of their intercourse."
1,"I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend beneath words."
1,"""Talk not of other season than this"" he cried."
1,"I have sought in vain for sleep and rest; my lids refused to close, and my blood was for ever in a tumult."
1,I stood ready to receive and reply to his reproaches.
1,"No one at Windsor would afford them shelter; so, going a little further up, they remained all night in a deserted hut near Bolter's lock."
1,"Idris arose also, and bent on me her eyes of celestial blue, and with grace peculiar said ""You hardly need an introduction; we have a picture, highly valued by my father, which declares at once your name."
1,"Pale and tearful, she almost forgot her duties as hostess; her eyes were fixed on her children."
1,My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
1,Raymond was actuated by far other feelings.
1,"I have lost you, myself, my life"" ""Do you not believe me?"" said Raymond haughtily."
1,"You are very young; let not this check for more than a moment retard your glorious course; hold on, beloved one."
1,"August th, You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles mine?"
1,"I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate and several other persons, to the inn."
1,"The plague I am told is in Constantinople, perhaps I have imbibed its effluvia perhaps disease is the real cause of my prognostications."
1,"What though those limbs moved not, and those lips could no more frame modulated accents of wisdom and love What though like a weed flung from the fruitless sea, he lay the prey of corruption still that was the form she had caressed, those the lips that meeting hers, had drank the spirit of love from the commingling breath; that was the earthly mechanism of dissoluble clay she had called her own."
1,"Accordingly, a few months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her repentant mother."
1,"Others will toss these pages lightly over: to you, Woodville, kind, affectionate friend, they will be dear the precious memorials of a heart broken girl who, dying, is still warmed by gratitude towards you: your tears will fall on the words that record my misfortunes; I know they will and while I have life I thank you for your sympathy."
1,"And do I dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?"
1,Do not turn from me; I do not ask you to reveal it: I only entreat you to listen to me and to become familiar with the voice of consolation and kindness.
1,Raymond questioned vainly; the mysterious Greek would say no more.
1,"Nor did Raymond make an end without drawing in vivid and glowing colours, the splendour of a kingdom, in opposition to the commercial spirit of republicanism."
1,I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator.
1,I now forget the cause of her departure if indeed I ever knew it.
1,The beatings of my human heart drew me back to blank reality.
1,"She fed even to tears of joy on the praise and glory of her Lord; her whole existence was one sacrifice to him, and if in the humility of her heart she felt self complacency, it arose from the reflection that she had won the distinguished hero of the age, and had for years preserved him, even after time had taken from love its usual nourishment."

1,"The question was no longer whether I should share Adrian's toils and danger; but in what manner I could, in Windsor and the neighbourhood, imitate the prudence and zeal which, under his government, produced order and plenty in London, and how, now pestilence had spread more widely, I could secure the health of my own family."
1,"""We have strange news here,"" I observed."
1,"His rank his least merit, do you say?"
1,"Alas I even now look back with disgust at my artifices and contrivances by which, after many painful struggles, I effected my retreat."
1,"I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires."
1,"If we went to Italy, to sacred and eternal Rome, we might with greater patience submit to the decree, which had laid her mighty towers low."
1,Justine was called on for her defence.
1,Sorrow fled before her; and her smile seemed to possess an influence like light to irradiate all mental darkness.
1,"On the last day, two candidates only were allowed to remain; and to obviate, if possible, the last struggle between these, a bribe was offered to him who should voluntarily resign his pretensions; a place of great emolument and honour was given him, and his success facilitated at a future election."

1,"My arrival was like the newly discovered lamp of a lighthouse to sailors, who are weathering some dangerous point."
1,"Reproach is indeed an idle word: for what should I reproach you?

1,"He did not leave me for many hours; not until he had improved the spark that he had kindled, and with an angelic hand fostered the return of somthing that seemed like joy."

1,Alas for human reason He accused the Greeks of superstition: what name did he give to the faith he lent to the predictions of Evadne?
1,"Adrian had the superiority in learning and eloquence; but Raymond possessed a quick penetration, and a practical knowledge of life, which usually displayed itself in opposition to Adrian, and thus kept up the ball of discussion."

1,"""Farewell for ever"" The moment I finished this letter I ordered the carriage and prepared to follow my father."
1,"When I slept or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me."
1,"""When I reflect, my dear cousin,"" said she, ""on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me."
1,and does he not delight singly in such efforts as manifest his love to all?
1,My improvement was his delight; he was with me during all my studies and assisted or joined with me in every lesson.
1,I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.
1,"When she found herself forsaken by him, she lost the heart to pursue her usual avocations; pride forbade every application to him; famine was welcomed as the kind porter to the gates of death, within whose opening folds she should now, without sin, quickly repose."

1,"We got into his carriage, and proceeded towards Windsor."
1,But it is a still greater evil to me that I am self educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas' books of voyages.
1,"""The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day."
1,"I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I received from the objects around me. Alas Why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders them more necessary beings."
