1,"This, proud noble, is your last night Perdita has bestowed on it all of magnificent and dazzling that your heart best loves but, from these gorgeous rooms, from this princely attendance, from power and elevation, you must return with to morrow's sun to our rural abode; for I would not buy an immortality of joy, by the endurance of one more week sister to the last."
1,"The fibres of his frame became relaxed, and cold dew stood on his forehead, at this idea."
1,"Adrian took pity on my faltering mien: ""Come with me,"" he said, ""I have much to say to you; come home with me you know who I am?"" ""Yes,"" I exclaimed, ""I do believe that I now know you, and that you will pardon my mistakes my crime."""
1,We were soon joined by Elizabeth.
1,"I turned angrily away: ""Verney,"" said Adrian, ""you are very cynical: sit down; or if you will not, perhaps, as you are not a frequent visitor, Lord Raymond will humour you, and accompany us, as we had previously agreed upon, to parliament."""
1,"The murderous mark of the fiend's grasp was on her neck, and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips."
1,"His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion."
1,"My privacy invaded, my actions censured, my friends insulted?"
1,To me this proceeding appeared if so light a term may be permitted extremely whimsical.
1,"Let me find the earthly dwelling of my beloved; let us rescue that from common dust, so that in times to come men may point to the sacred tomb, and name it his then to other thoughts, and a new course of life, or what else fate, in her cruel tyranny, may have marked out for me."""
1,"This event caused many of those who were about to sail, to put foot again on firm land, ready to encounter any evil rather than to rush into the yawning jaws of the pitiless ocean."
1,The plague is now in progress it is useless closing one's eyes to the fact the deaths encrease each week.
1,My reply was ready; a reproach I deemed calculated to sting his very heart.
1,"Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling places."
1,"Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself."
1,"""The relatives of the Earl of Windsor,"" said she haughtily, ""doubtless think that I injured him; perhaps the Earl himself would be the first to acquit me, but probably I do not deserve acquittal."
1,And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life.
1,"There was so much intelligence combined with innocence, sensibility with forbearance, and seriousness with perfect good humour, a beauty so transcendant, united to such endearing simplicity, that she hung like a pearl in the shrine of our possessions, a treasure of wonder and excellence."
1,"We were all equal now; but near at hand was an equality still more levelling, a state where beauty and strength, and wisdom, would be as vain as riches and birth."
1,"The foreigners whom we had among us, who had fled from the plague in their own country, now saw their last asylum invaded; and, fear making them garrulous, they described to eager listeners the miseries they had beheld in cities visited by the calamity, and gave fearful accounts of the insidious and irremediable nature of the disease."
1,"Lights now appeared to guide us; and a long suite of splendid rooms illuminated, made us still more wonder."
1,"His vivacity, intelligence, and active spirit of benevolence, completed the conquest."
1,"It was as I said, the nineteenth of October; the autumn was far advanced and dreary."
1,"""He is safe"" said Idris, as he leapt on shore, and waved the bough over his head in token of success; ""we will wait for him here."""
1,"The glare of flames attested the progress of destruction, while, during mingled light and obscurity, the piles around me took gigantic proportions and weird shapes."
1,It was impossible to effect any thing in so short a time.
1,"I followed her, and strove to inspire more hope than I could myself entertain; but she shook her head mournfully."
1,"""That is also my victim"" he exclaimed."
1,"As a last effort, my sister mustered her strength, her firmness; she stepped from one boat to the other, and then with a shriek she sprang towards Raymond, knelt at his side, and glueing her lips to the hand she seized, her face shrouded by her long hair, gave herself up to tears."
1,"Listen to me, and then reflect if you ought to win me to your project, even if with the over bearing eloquence of despair you could make black death so inviting that the fair heaven should appear darkness."
1,"But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man."
1,"Oh Beloved One, I am borne away; I can no longer sustain myself; surely this is death that is coming."
1,"At first, relieved from famine and the grave, watched over by Raymond with the tenderest assiduity, with that feeling of repose peculiar to convalescence, Evadne gave herself up to rapturous gratitude and love."
1,"Ever since my recovery from the fever I had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life."
1,Yet let me a little retract from this sentence I have passed on myself.
1,"Farewell, Frankenstein If thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction."
1,"His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and he replied, ""To seek one who fled from me."" ""And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?"""
1,We rise; one wand'ring thought pollutes the day.
1,The day of my departure at length arrived.
1,"I received him at the door of my cottage and leading him solemnly into the room, I said: ""My friend, I wish to die."
1,"It seems as if the giant waves of ocean, and vast arms of the sea, were about to wrench the deep rooted island from its centre; and cast it, a ruin and a wreck, upon the fields of the Atlantic."
1,"Maternal affection had not rendered Idris selfish; at the beginning of our calamity she had, with thoughtless enthusiasm, devoted herself to the care of the sick and helpless."
1,"The father of Adrian yielded up the already broken sceptre of England; but I will rear the fallen plant, join its dismembered frame, and exalt it above all the flowers of the field."
1,"In our happiest days, Perdita had adorned her cottage with every aid art might bring, to that which nature had selected to favour."
1,"The females received them on their return with the simple and affectionate welcome known before only to the lowly cottage a clean hearth and bright fire; the supper ready cooked by beloved hands; gratitude for the provision for to morrow's meal: strange enjoyments for the high born English, yet they were now their sole, hard earned, and dearly prized luxuries."
1,"They only saw a poor girl broken in spirit, who spoke in a low and gentle voice, and from underneath whose downcast lids tears would sometimes steal which she strove to hide."
1,Her own feeling was as entire as at its birth.
1,"But while I live, promise not to betray me; promise, my child."""
1,Thou and nature are still true to me.
1,"Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through."
1,"I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere."
1,"Or after life No, no, I will not persuade myself to die, I may not, dare not."
1,"So saying, he hastened away, vaulted on his horse, and with a gesture as if he gave me his hand to kiss, bade me another laughing adieu."
1,"He must have been astonished at our conclave, disturbed by it I should have thought; but nothing of this appeared; he saluted my companions, and addressed me with a cordial greeting."
1,"Remember, that I love her still, that my dearest hope is that she will again be mine."
1,"""No, no,"" he said, ""do not deceive yourself, me you cannot."
1,Such acts were not wanting to adorn the grim train that waited on the progress of the plague.
1,"He was found stiff, his hands clenched, and pressed against his breast."
1,"""You are in the wrong,"" replied the fiend; ""and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you."
1,"The solution that seemed to me the most probable was that during his residence in London he had fallen in love with some unworthy person, and that his passion mastered him although he would not gratify it: he loved me too well to sacrifise me to this inclination, and that he had now visited this house that by reviving the memory of my mother whom he so passionately adored he might weaken the present impression."
1,"Adrian replied, ""Whither indeed would you fly?"
1,"Let your compassion be moved, and do not disdain me."
1,"No, he had determined to die, and he wished to spare me the misery of knowing it."
1,"Idris sat at the bedside, holding Evelyn's hand; we were afraid to speak to each other; I watched the stars I hung over my child I felt his little pulse I drew near the mother again I receded."
1,Then we shall find Elinor and what I have lost.
1,"I no longer exhaust my miserable heart by bitter tears and frantic complaints; I no longer the sic reproach the sun, the earth, the air, for pain and wretchedness."
1,Raymond gave her his ring to ensure the respect of the menials.
1,This his selected task was exchanged for the far different one of encountering the ruin caused by the convulsions of physical nature.
1,"The solitude became intolerable I placed my hand on the beating heart of Idris, I bent my head to catch the sound of her breath, to assure myself that she still existed for a moment I doubted whether I should not awake her; so effeminate an horror ran through my frame."
1,"He had schemed, if he failed in his present attempt, without taking leave of any of us, to embark for Greece, and never again to revisit England."
1,How petty do the actions of our earthly life appear when the whole universe is opened to our gaze yet there our passions are deep irrisisbable sic and as we are floating hopless yet clinging to hope down the impetuous stream can we perceive the beauty of its banks which alas my soul was too turbid to reflect If knowledge is the end of our being why are passions feelings implanted in us that hurries sic us from wisdom to selfconcentrated misery narrow selfish feeling?
1,Jealousy and disquiet were unknown among us; nor did a fear or hope of change ever disturb our tranquillity.
1,"The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others."
1,"In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life."
1,"""When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings."
1,But I have less courage than you and even thus accompanied I dare not die.
1,"One voice made of many voices, resounded through the chamber; it syllabled the name of Raymond."
1,"You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction."""
1,"During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure."
1,"Return speedily, Lionel."""
1,"The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps."
1,I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking.
1,It was whispered that he had died of the plague.
1,It devolved on me to disclose our plan to Idris.
1,"On this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me."
1,I even now blush at the falsehoods I uttered; my heart sickens: I will leave this complication of what I hope I may in a manner call innocent deceit to be imagined by the reader.
1,"When I returned to Perdita, I found that she had already been informed of the success of my undertaking."
1,"Methinks his spirit remains here as well as that dust, which, uncommunicable though it be, is more precious in its nothingness than aught else widowed earth clasps to her sorrowing bosom."
1,"Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome."
1,"No man could crush a ""butterfly on the wheel"" with better effect; no man better cover a speedy retreat from a powerful adversary."
1,"""Assuredly a most benignant power built up the majestic fabric we inhabit, and framed the laws by which it endures."
1,"Adrian was on horseback; he rode up to the carriage, and his gaiety, in addition to that of Raymond, dispelled my sister's melancholy."
1,"If his heart had slept but a few years longer, he might have been saved; but it awoke in its infancy; it had power, but no knowledge; and it was ruined, even as a too early blowing bud is nipt by the killing frost."
1,"He obeyed her injunctions, and passed a year in exile in Cumberland."
1,"Sleep was not sleep, for her waking thoughts, bridled by some remains of reason, and by the sight of her children happy and in health, were then transformed to wild dreams, all her terrors were realized, all her fears received their dread fulfilment."
1,"As we advanced, we were met by bands of peasantry, whose almost naked condition, whose despair and horror, told at once the fierce nature of the coming enemy."
1,A presentiment of ill hung over her.
1,"I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly."
1,"This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room."
1,"From the moment that he adopted this idea, he was changed."
1,"He would embark in a balloon; he would sail for a distant quarter of the world, where his name and humiliation were unknown."
1,He demanded the place of deputy as his right.
1,"Before, she had been visited by pangs of fear now, she never enjoyed an interval of hope."
1,When he was nineteen his mother died.
1,"He is irrecoverably mad."""
1,"He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive."
1,"""It is not from deck,"" said the man at the helm, ""something has been thrown from the aft cabin."""
1,Clara and Alfred followed.
1,"""My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent."""
1,"Idris, the most affectionate wife, sister and friend, was a tender and loving mother."
1,"Such a man has a double existence: he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures."
1,"There then in that castle in Windsor Castle, birth place of Idris and my babes, should be the haven and retreat for the wrecked bark of human society."
1,"But I will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted towards England and towards you, I will not despond."
1,His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved.
1,"They are vain, I know; how very vain in their attempt to soothe or comfort me."
1,"At last the crisis came: the night when parliament, which had so long delayed its choice, must decide: as the hour of twelve passed, and the new day began, it was by virtue of the constitution dissolved, its power extinct."
1,"Were those the fertile fields I loved was that the interchange of gentle upland and cultivated dale, once covered with waving corn, diversified by stately trees, watered by the meandering Thames?"
1,"I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets."
1,"Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime."
1,He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it.
1,Not that this indulgence was devoid of accompanying grief.
1,"The guides bring with them materials for renewing the light, but we had none our only resource was to return as we came."
1,"Confinement and hardship had undermined his health; the Turks feared an accomplishment of the threats of the English government, if he died under their hands; they looked upon his recovery as impossible; they delivered him up as a dying man, willingly making over to us the rites of burial."
1,"He rose and quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it."
1,"Would that I also had a career Would that I could freight some untried bark with all my hopes, energies, and desires, and launch it forth into the ocean of life bound for some attainable point, with ambition or pleasure at the helm But adverse winds detain me on shore; like Ulysses, I sit at the water's edge and weep."
1,"I told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library to attend their usual hour of rising."
1,"Unfeeling, heartless creator You had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind."
1,"Carriages and horses were provided for all; captains and under officers chosen, and the whole assemblage wisely organized."
1,"""This trait of kindness moved me sensibly."
1,"My only excuse for thus transforming them, is that they were unintelligible in their pristine condition."
1,"Alas I am a most unhappy creature"" I was breathless with emotion, and I paused fixing my earnest eyes on my father, after I had dashed away the intrusive tears that dimmed them."
1,"Joy and exultation, were mine, to possess, and to save her."
1,"She could not divine, that the breach which she had occasioned between Raymond and Perdita was already irreparable: but she knew, that under the present system it would be widened each day, and that its result must be to destroy her lover's happiness, and to implant the fangs of remorse in his heart."
1,"And, as accident permitted, I complied with or refused her request."
1,"You have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man."
1,"""The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since I awoke into life."
1,"It is true that the necessaries of life were assembled in such quantities, as to supply to superfluity the wants of the diminished population; but still much labour was required to arrange these, as it were, raw materials; and depressed by sickness, and fearful of the future, we had not energy to enter boldly and decidedly on any system."
1,The next step was to induce Raymond to confess his secret wishes for dignity and fame.
1,"Accordingly I hid myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation."
1,"If I grieved it was for your mother, if I loved it was your image; these sole emotions filled my heart in quietness."
1,"""Raymond has prophesied well,"" said Perdita, ""alas, that it should be so our present mode of life cannot continue long, yet I will not be the first to propose alteration."
1,"Thus, while the wise, the good, and the prudent were occupied by the labours of benevolence, the truce of winter produced other effects among the young, the thoughtless, and the vicious."
1,"From this time Felix was more employed, and the heart moving indications of impending famine disappeared."
1,"The sun's rays were refracted from the pavement and buildings the stoppage of the public fountains the bad quality of the food, and scarcity even of that, produced a state of suffering, which was aggravated by the scourge of disease; while the garrison arrogated every superfluity to themselves, adding by waste and riot to the necessary evils of the time."
1,Would they dare wrong him thus?
1,"Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom."
1,"Its ponderous mass, blackened stone, and high dome, made it look, not like a temple, but a tomb."
1,"""Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger."
1,"Adrian it is true had already gone to seek the fugitive, imagining that her tameless anxiety had led her to the purlieus of the House, and that some sinister event detained her."
1,We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
1,"Her mother ended with a look of contempt and covert triumph, which for a moment awakened the suspicions of Idris."
1,"In the heart of one like me there are secret thoughts working, and secret tortures which you ought not to seek to discover."
1,"If he had permitted us to witness his agitation, he would have been more under the guidance of reason; but his struggles for the shew of composure, acted with such violence on his nerves, as to destroy his power of self command."
1,"I had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing such as even Dante could not have conceived."
1,On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.
1,"I have often thought of offering my services to the pestilence stricken towns of France and Italy; but fear of paining you, and expectation of this catastrophe, withheld me."
1,"In August, the plague had appeared in the country of England, and during September it made its ravages."
1,"Languor was changed to ardour, the slow step converted to a speedy pace, while the hollow murmur of the multitude, inspired by one feeling, and that deadly, filled the air, drowning the clang of arms and sound of music."
1,I should certainly have died if you had not hastened to me.
1,Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.
1,"Do you believe, Verney, that I brought you to town for that?"
1,"She started wildly from her couch, and flew to the cabin window."
1,"How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land."
1,"The concentrated pride of her nature, forgotten during her blissful dream, awoke, and with its adder's sting pierced her heart; her humility of spirit augmented the power of the venom; she had been exalted in her own estimation, while distinguished by his love: of what worth was she, now that he thrust her from this preferment?"
1,"She felt as if during her past calm she had dreamed, but was now awake; she was As one In some lone watch tower on the deep, awakened From soothing visions of the home he loves, Trembling to hear the wrathful billows roar; as one who has been cradled by a storm, and awakes to find the vessel sinking."
1,I remained for several years their only child.
1,There was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness towards my enemies?
1,Evadne was eighteen years of age.
1,"The world is vast, and England, though her many fields and wide spread woods seem interminable, is but a small part of her."
1,"When I am addressed, her name is the sound I expect: in every communication, I imagine that she will form a part."
1,"Better die at once better plunge a poinard in her bosom, still untouched by drear adversity, and then again sheathe it in my own But, no; in times of misery we must fight against our destinies, and strive not to be overcome by them."
1,"You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed."
1,"I can enchain the plague in limits, and set a term to the misery it would occasion; courage, forbearance, and watchfulness, are the forces I bring towards this great work."
1,"I saw plainly that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply."
1,"The praise of men, power and high aspirations attended your career."
1,"She tried to disperse them, but they refused to be checked her utterance was choaked."
1,But it is unworthy of me to argue and complain.
1,"It was more common, for all who possessed landed property to secede to their estates, attended by whole troops of the indigent, to cut down their woods to erect temporary dwellings, and to portion out their parks, parterres and flower gardens, to necessitous families."
1,"She hardly looked up ""You can do me no good,"" she replied; ""I must go to the hospital; if I do not die before I get there."""
1,"She leaned from the window looking on the forest, and the turrets of the Castle, and as these became hid by intervening objects, she passionately exclaimed ""Scenes of happiness scenes sacred to devoted love, when shall I see you again and when I see ye, shall I be still the beloved and joyous Perdita, or shall I, heart broken and lost, wander among your groves, the ghost of what I am"" ""Why, silly one,"" cried Raymond, ""what is your little head pondering upon, that of a sudden you have become so sublimely dismal?"
1,"But there was a fearlessness and frankness about her, which said that she would not encroach on another's liberty, but held her own sacred and unassailable."
1,"The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale."
1,"His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me."
1,"Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul."
1,and day Like a thin exhalation melt away Both wrapping up their beams in clouds to be Themselves close mourners at this obsequie.
1,"Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder, ""My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this?"
1,"Each felt, that England had never seen a Protector so capable of fulfilling the arduous duties of that high office."
1,"We sat in his library, and he spoke of the old Greek sages, and of the power which they had acquired over the minds of men, through the force of love and wisdom only."
1,"There is no more painful sight than that of untimely care in children, and it was particularly observable in one whose disposition had heretofore been mirthful."
1,"I told him of the business of the evening, and a smile relaxed the contracted muscles."
1,"Since then, the influence of the landed proprietors had augmented; and at first Ryland was not sorry to observe the machinations of Lord Raymond, which drew off many of his opponent's partizans."
1,The first secret that had existed between them was the visits of Raymond to Evadne.
1,"It was a place fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves."
1,"At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted, and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, 'O God I have murdered my darling child' ""She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty."
1,"I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot."
1,"I cannot live the object of suspicion you cannot believe me let us part"" ""Exactly so,"" cried Perdita, ""I knew that it would come to this Are we not already parted?"
1,"""Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain."
1,"Vanity first prompted me to ask you: vanity, I call it; yet even in this I see the hand of fate your presence will soon be necessary; you will become the last resource of Perdita, her protector and consoler."
1,"Yet at this time, with human fondness, she clung to all that her human senses permitted her to see and feel to be a part of Raymond."
1,"Thus I promised myself, as I journied towards my destination with roused and ardent expectation: expectation of the fulfilment of all that in boyhood we promise ourselves of power and enjoyment in maturity."
1,"The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced."
1,"It was after one tremendous day when his eyes had glared on me like lightning and his voice sharp and broken seemed unable to express the extent of his emotion that in the evening when I was alone he joined me with a calm countenance, and not noticing my tears which I quickly dried when he approached, told me that in three days that sic he intended to remove with me to his estate in Yorkshire, and bidding me prepare left me hastily as if afraid of being questioned."
1,The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses.
1,"But pardon me, I entreat you and listen to me: do not turn away from me; do not be impatient; you may easily intimidate me into silence, but my heart is bursting, nor can I willingly consent to endure for one moment longer the agony of uncertitude which for the last four months has been my portion."
1,"In vain I shewed him, that when winter came, the cold would dissipate the pestilential air, and restore courage to the Greeks."
1,"When I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm."
1,I have no ambition to lose my life on the post road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel.
1,"They arrived at the age when they were sent to fulfil their destined situations in life; while I, an outcast, with none to lead or drive me forward, paused."
1,My father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognized in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.
1,"Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day's experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity."
1,My affections were human; hope and love were the day stars of my life.
1,The Countess of Windsor was by nature full of energetic feeling; but she had very seldom in her life permitted the concentrated emotions of her heart to shew themselves on her features.
1,"""As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast."
1,"When my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub a creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills."
1,All that I possessed of the luxuries of life came from him.
1,"Ryland was a man of obscure birth and of immense wealth, inherited from his father, who had been a manufacturer."
1,"I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me."
1,"Raymond was as usual courteous, though there was, on occasions, an unbidden haughtiness, or painful abruptness in his manners, which startled his gentle friend; his brow was not clouded but disdain sat on his lips, and his voice was harsh."
1,"I sympathized with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none."
1,"Meanwhile among our guests in the park, all thoughts of festivity had faded."
1,I felt that this was insanity I sprang forward to throw it off; I rushed into the midst of the crowd.
1,"Day after day passed while we discussed our projects for the evening, and each night was occupied by debates which offered no conclusion."
1,"""Exactly so,"" replied Raymond, ""another link of the breakless chain."
1,"I wept as I listened to him; and after we had taken an affectionate farewell, I followed him far with my eyes until they saw the last of my earthly comforter."
1,"The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on the same studies."
1,"While the earth lasts, his actions will be recorded with praise."
1,But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction.
1,"On her return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost."
1,Yet I am certainly unjust.
1,"The curtain drew up, and the stage presented the scene of the witches' cave."
1,"Should I return to the Castle, to my wife and children, with this taint upon me?"
1,I have been miserably mistaken in imagining that I could conquer my love for you; I never can.
1,Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves.
1,We went out with the resolution of disputing with our foe.
1,I planned the whole scene with an earnest heart and franticly set my soul on this project.
1,"""Is this your promised zeal?"" ""Pardon me,"" I said, ""but even as you speak, I am gone."""
1,I could read the influence of my friend in their quickened motions and cheerful faces.
1,"In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly miserable."""
1,"If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my former studies."
1,"I do not know that any will peruse these pages except you, my friend, who will receive them at my death."
1,"For awhile my labours were not solitary; but that time is gone; and, with the selected and matchless companion of my toils, their dearest reward is also lost to me Di mie tenere frondi altro lavoro Credea mostrarte; e qual fero pianeta Ne' nvidio insieme, o mio nobil tesoro?"
1,"I consented to her request, and taking her little hand, followed Raymond."
1,A truce was concluded between the Greeks and Turks.
1,"But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined, the seal to my fate."
1,"She entered the cottages of the sick; she relieved their wants with her own hand; she betrayed no fear, and inspired all who saw her with some portion of her own native courage."
1,"Perdita, even where she loved, was reserved and timid; Idris was frank and confiding."
1,The house then dissolved.
1,"He sat at a table with several secretaries, who were arranging petitions, or registering the notes made during that day's audience."
1,I tell you we are no longer miserable mortals; we are about to become Gods; spirits free and happy as gods.
1,"Oh How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness."
1,"Early in the day, Argyropylo was wounded dangerously, and Raymond assumed the command of the whole army."
1,"The studied immovability of her countenance; her slow, equable manner, and soft but unmelodious voice, were a mask, hiding her fiery passions, and the impatience of her disposition."
1,"The attachment between them led to the ill fated marriage, of which I was the offspring."
1,"Never did any woman appear so entirely made of mind, as the Countess of Windsor."
1,"I have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to perform it myself I figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin."
1,"Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy."
1,Never mark me never will I leave this spot.
1,On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.
1,Quito was destroyed by an earthquake.
1,"There was room enough indeed in our hapless country for twice the number of invaders; but their lawless spirit instigated them to violence; they took a delight in thrusting the possessors from their houses; in seizing on some mansion of luxury, where the noble dwellers secluded themselves in fear of the plague; in forcing these of either sex to become their servants and purveyors; till, the ruin complete in one place, they removed their locust visitation to another."
1,"What are your plans, my Lord Protector, for the benefit of our country?"""
1,And then of what use would be pursuit?
1,"She fears for the children she adores, and for you, the father of these, her lover, husband, protector; and you must be near her to support and encourage her."
1,"It was in the hey day of youth, in the pride of boyish folly."
1,"She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots."
1,"The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields."
1,"These disasters came home to so many bosoms, and, through the various channels of commerce, were carried so entirely into every class and division of the community, that of necessity they became the first question in the state, the chief subjects to which we must turn our attention."
1,"About five in the morning I discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the print of the murder's finger was on his neck."
1,I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.
1,"First, he would look in on Evadne; he would not stay; but he owed her some account, some compensation for his long and unannounced absence; and then to Perdita, to the forgotten world, to the duties of society, the splendour of rank, the enjoyment of power."
1,"The earth, late wide circus for the display of dignified exploits, vast theatre for a magnificent drama, now presented a vacant space, an empty stage for actor or spectator there was no longer aught to say or hear."
1,"He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance."
1,"For some time, the spirit of hilarity was kept up; but, at length, Perdita receded from the piano, for Raymond had joined in the trio of ""Taci ingiusto core,"" in Don Giovanni, whose arch entreaty was softened by him into tenderness, and thrilled her heart with memories of the changed past; it was the same voice, the same tone, the self same sounds and words, which often before she had received, as the homage of love to her no longer was it that; and this concord of sound with its dissonance of expression penetrated her with regret and despair."
1,"Farewell, my only living friend; you are the sole tie that binds me to existence, and now I break it."
1,"""I swear,"" he cried, ""by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again."
1,"I could not however at that time feel remorse, for methought I was born anew; my soul threw off the burthen of past sin, to commence a new career in innocence and love."
1,"But they were the property of Adrian, the nurslings of Idris; and so, although my imagination rendered sensual by privation, made me think that they would better become the spit in my kitchen, than the green leaves of the forest, Nathelesse, I checked my haughty will, and did not eat; but supped upon sentiment, and dreamt vainly of ""such morsels sweet,"" as I might not waking attain."
1,"Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent."""
1,"He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere."
1,"""She is innocent, my Elizabeth,"" said I, ""and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal."""
1,"Soon her door opened softly, and on her springing up, she heard a whisper, ""Not asleep yet,"" and the door again closed."
1,On one side was a small opening.
1,"By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes."
1,"It is painful, I allow, destructive, impracticable."
1,"It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before."
1,"Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family, could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?"""
1,"It was found, that, though at first the stop put to all circulation of property, had reduced those before supported by the factitious wants of society to sudden and hideous poverty, yet when the boundaries of private possession were thrown down, the products of human labour at present existing were more, far more, than the thinned generation could possibly consume."
1,"Our talk was on subjects, unconnected with the emotions that evidently occupied each; but we each divined the other's thought, and as our voices spoke of indifferent matters, our eyes, in mute language, told a thousand things no tongue could have uttered."
1,"He mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided."
1,"We will set up a candidate, and ensure his success."
1,"""I have lived my last winter, and the date of this year, , will be carved upon my tomb."
1,"Adrian, the matchless brother of my soul, the sensitive and excellent Adrian, loving all, and beloved by all, yet seemed destined not to find the half of himself, which was to complete his happiness."
1,"Some reflection seemed to sting him, and the spasm of pain that for a moment convulsed his countenance, checked my indignation."
1,"My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness."
1,"The sensation is most dreary, to use no stronger term, with which one looks forward to passing the long hours of night beside a sick bed, especially if the patient be an infant, who cannot explain its pain, and whose flickering life resembles the wasting flame of the watch light, Whose narrow fire Is shaken by the wind, and on whose edge Devouring darkness hovers."
1,"""Nay,"" said my companion, ""I can free you from your present impediment."
1,Perdita looked at him like one amazed; her expressive countenance shone for a moment with tenderness; to see him only was happiness.
1,"When I adverted to the question of their entire separation, she replied: ""Be it so One day the period will arrive; I know it, and feel it."
1,"""Do not degrade me in my own eyes,"" she said; ""poverty has long been my nurse; hard visaged she is, but honest."
1,"Now it seemed to me to be as a various river flowing through a fertile and lovely lanscape, ever changing and ever beautiful."
1,"All this appeared to me, I own, methodized madness."
1,Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold.
1,"The vast annihilation that has swallowed all things the voiceless solitude of the once busy earth the lonely state of singleness which hems me in, has deprived even such details of their stinging reality, and mellowing the lurid tints of past anguish with poetic hues, I am able to escape from the mosaic of circumstance, by perceiving and reflecting back the grouping and combined colouring of the past."
1,"It was not long since I was like one of these beardless aspirants; when my boy shall have obtained the place I now hold, I shall have tottered into a grey headed, wrinkled old man."
1,"""He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth."
1,"The blood of my forefathers cries aloud in my veins, and bids me be first among my countrymen."
1,I will not dwell longer than I need on these disastrous circumstances.
1,In life I dared not; in death I unveil the mystery.
1,"She saw my despondency, and the aching cares of Idris."
1,"Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I grew restless and nervous."
1,"He began at last to shew signs of angry impatience, and Perdita became aware that the system she had adopted could not continue; she must explain herself to him; she could not summon courage to speak she wrote thus: ""Read this letter with patience, I entreat you."
1,"A light railing surrounded the garden of the cottage, which, low roofed, seemed to submit to the majesty of nature, and cower amidst the venerable remains of forgotten time."
1,"How delicious to me were the words of his letter that concerned me: ""I cannot tell you,"" it said, ""how ardently I desire to see my Mathilda."
1,Elizabeth was sad and desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed.
1,"I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror."
1,I was sought after therefore with less care than would otherwise have been the case; and soon all trace and memory of me was lost.
1,"My uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your powers of application."
1,"Then again she sadly lamented her hard fate; that a woman, with a woman's heart and sensibility, should be driven by hopeless love and vacant hopes to take up the trade of arms, and suffer beyond the endurance of man privation, labour, and pain the while her dry, hot hand pressed mine, and her brow and lips burned with consuming fire."
1,I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.
1,"My first resolution was to quit Geneva forever; my country, which, when I was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became hateful."
1,"I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had contemplated during the day."
1,"Listen to me, Frankenstein."
1,I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.
1,He seemed to cherish a mild grief and softer emotions although sad as a relief from despair He contrived in many ways to nurse his melancholy as an antidote to wilder passion.
1,"First I must seek Adrian, and restore him to her."
1,"I procured Laudanum and placing it in two glasses on the table, filled my room with flowers and decorated the last scene of my tragedy with the nicest care."
1,She alone knew the weight which Raymond attached to his success.
1,Yet how was I to do this?
1,"These volumes were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life."
1,"There was evidently something behind all this; yet, when he appeared about to speak of that which was nearest his heart, he would abruptly turn away, and with a sigh endeavour to deliver the painful idea to the winds."
1,"I would not marry a reigning sovereign, were I not sure that her heart was free."
1,"The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it."
1,"His passions, always his masters, acquired fresh strength, from the long sleep in which love had cradled them, the clinging weight of destiny bent him down; he was goaded, tortured, fiercely impatient of that worst of miseries, the sense of remorse."
1,"Two years passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make."
1,"He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity returned."
1,The mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved Felix were not for me.
1,"In reply, my sister requested me to accompany her the following evening to the tomb of Raymond."
1,The summer sun shone in an unclouded sky; the air was close but all was cool to me except my own scorching skin.
1,"Her power, which was linked to few of the enduring emotions of his heart, had greatly decayed."
1,"Soon we heard their disorderly clamour, the barbarian shouts, the untimed step of thousands coming on in disarray."
1,"His emissary obeyed, and brought the desired intelligence."
1,"As the trial had proceeded, her countenance had altered."
1,"On a sudden I heard a gentle step ascending the stairs; I paused breathless, and as it approached glided into an obscure corner of the room; the steps paused at my door, but after a few moments they again receeded, descended the stairs and I heard no more."
1,"The war, which about a year before the present time had broken out between Greece and Turkey, brought about many reverses of fortune."
1,"The quiet was disturbed only by the rush of waters as they divided before the steady keel, the murmur of the moveless and full sails, the wind whistling in the shrouds, and the regular motion of the engine."
1,Our friend resolved however not to be foiled in his wish.
1,"""You swear,"" I said, ""to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you?"
1,He admitted that the principles that I laid down were the best; but he denied that they were the only ones.
1,"This appeared to him the primary step towards manhood, and he was proportionably pleased."
1,"I hardly replied to the slightest question, and was uneasy when I saw a human creature near me."
1,He was detained three days longer and then he hastened to her.
1,"We reached London, methought, all too soon; and yet I could not regret our speedy arrival, when I witnessed the extasy with which my beloved girl found herself in her brother's arms, safe from every evil, under his unblamed protection."
1,"I turned from the awful ruin of the Golden City, and, after great exertion, succeeded in extricating myself from its enclosure."
1,"My beloved friends were alarmed nay, they expressed their alarm so anxiously, that I dared not pronounce the word plague, that hovered on my lips, lest they should construe my perturbed looks into a symptom, and see infection in my languor."
1,"They were in the end all sunk, and, with the exception of two or three prisoners, the crews drowned."
1,"Was it not enough that we must die, but toil must be added?"
1,"But it was winter now, and months must elapse before we are hurled from our security."
1,"I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone."
1,"Since then I must be an object of indifference or contempt to her, better, far better avoid her, nor expose myself before her and the scornful world to the chance of playing the mad game of a fond, foolish Icarus."
1,"Besides, Perdita was with him in his retirement; she saw the moodiness that succeeded to this forced hilarity; she marked his disturbed sleep, his painful irritability once she had seen his tears hers had scarce ceased to flow, since she had beheld the big drops which disappointed pride had caused to gather in his eye, but which pride was unable to dispel."
1,"He had her then removed to a more commodious dwelling, and hovered about her, again and again to assure himself that she was safe."
1,"You may give up your purpose, but mine is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not."
1,"September nd My beloved Sister, I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit it."
1,I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply.
1,"Shame shame if the first magistrate of England be foremost to renounce his duties."""
1,I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill fated and admirable friend.
1,At first these agonizing plaints filled me with intolerable compassion.
1,"I can ill record the flow of language and graceful turns of expression, the wit and easy raillery that gave vigour and influence to his speech."
1,"The lightness of heart which had dressed them in masquerade habits, had decorated their tents, and assembled them in fantastic groups, appeared a sin against, and a provocative to, the awful destiny that had laid its palsying hand upon hope and life."
1,"For many months Woodville had in vain endeavoured to cast off this terrible remembrance; it still hung on him untill memory was too great a burthen for his loaded soul, but when on horseback the spell that seemingly held him to this idea was snapt; then if he thought of his lost bride he pictured her radiant in beauty; he could hear her voice, and fancy her ""a sylvan Huntress by his side,"" while his eyes brightened as he thought he gazed on her cherished form."
1,All this has a different effect upon Raymond.
1,I slept too undisturbed by dreams; and awoke refreshed to again enjoy my tranquil freedom.
1,But reflection returned with health.
1,He comforted her; he instilled into her his own hopes and desires; and soon her countenance beamed with sympathy.
1,"I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep."
1,He left college on this event and shaking off for a while his old friends he retired to the neighbourhood of his Diana and received all his consolation from her sweet voice and dearer caresses.
1,"At least it would be a benevolent action to rescue the sufferer, whether human or brute, from the desolation of the town; so, sending Clara back to her home, I again entered Constantinople."
1,"""Once I desired to be a king."
1,"They were her life; dearer than a spot consecrated to love, dearer than all else the earth contained."
1,"Alas I now met frowns where before I had been welcomed only with smiles: he, my beloved father, shunned me, and either treated me with harshness or a more heart breaking coldness."
1,"Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death."
1,"""And were she,"" said Raymond, ""I would not advise her seeing him."
1,"Our own distresses, though they were occasioned by the fictitious reciprocity of commerce, encreased in due proportion."
1,"Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together."
1,Be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock.
1,"""Adrian, I am about to return to Greece, to become again a soldier, perhaps a conqueror."
1,"Her mind was of uncommon strength; she could subdue her sensible wants to her mental wishes, and suffer cold, hunger and misery, rather than concede to fortune a contested point."
1,This purpose is now accomplished; he will never see me more.
1,Our dainty fare was often exchanged for blows and imprisonment.
1,"My rage is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon society, still exists."
1,It was in Rome the Queen of the World that I suffered a misfortune that reduced me to misery despair The bright sun deep azure sky were oppressive but nought was so hateful as the voice of Man I loved to walk by the shores of the Tiber which were solitary if the sirocco blew to see the swift clouds pass over St. Peters and the many domes of Rome or if the sun shone I turned my eyes from the sky whose light was too dazzling gay to be reflected in my tearful eyes I turned them to the river whose swift course was as the speedy departure of happiness and whose turbid colour was gloomy as grief Whether I slept I know not or whether it was in one of those many hours which I spent seated on the ground my mind a chaos of despair my eyes for ever wet by tears but I was here visited by a lovely spirit whom I have ever worshiped who tried to repay my adoration by diverting my mind from the hideous memories that racked it.
1,Oh No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.
1,"He was ready to go back to old times, and commemorate the contests of our fathers, and the monarch's abdication."
1,"There was a simple, natural earnestness about her that interested me in her fate, especially when she assured me that her husband was the best of men, had been so, till want of business during these unhappy times had thrown him into bad company."
1,"The noisy joy of the populace, the gaudy colours of their dress, the tumult of carriages and horses, the march of soldiers intermixed, the waving of banners and sound of martial music added to the high excitement of the scene; while round us reposed in solemn majesty the relics of antient time."
1,Even I was dispatched to a distant part of the field.
1,"Oft when I have listened with gasping attention for the sound of the ocean mingled with my father's groans; and then wept untill my strength was gone and I was calm and faint, when I have recollected all this I have asked myself if this were not madness."
1,"After all the agitation and sorrow I had endured in Greece, I sought Windsor, as the storm driven bird does the nest in which it may fold its wings in tranquillity."
1,"But the haughty Ex Queen thought as Octavius Caesar and Mark Antony, We could not stall together In the whole world."
1,"Clara got rid also of her restraint; Adrian and she had been old playfellows; and now, as they walked or rode together, he yielded to her earnest entreaty, and repeated, for the hundredth time, some tale of her father's bravery, munificence, or justice."
1,"Now each life was a gem, each human breathing form of far, O far more worth than subtlest imagery of sculptured stone; and the daily, nay, hourly decrease visible in our numbers, visited the heart with sickening misery."
1,"Now I am the first man in the state, burthen of every ballad, and object of old women's mumbled devotions."
1,"Looking timidly around, as if she feared to be overheard, she whispered: ""I have discovered to morrow that is, to day already the to morrow is come before dawn, foreigners, Austrians, my mother's hirelings, are to carry me off to Germany, to prison, to marriage to anything, except you and my brother take me away, or soon they will be here"" I was frightened by her vehemence, and imagined some mistake in her incoherent tale; but I no longer hesitated to obey her."
1,"Evadne did not answer; her large dark eyes were cast down, at length a tear glimmered on the lashes."
1,"Every motive, every threat, every angry taunt was urged in vain."
1,"If my last combat is now about to be fought, and I am to be worsted so let it be"" ""But come, Ryland, recollect yourself Men have hitherto thought you magnanimous and wise, will you cast aside these titles?"
1,"Alas my companion did, and I was precipitated in his fall."
1,"Even to us he assumed gaiety and hope, and assumed them so well, that we did not divine the secret workings of his mind."
1,"Tell me, can I do nothing?"
1,For long years these are the first days of peace that have visited me.
1,"Not in the calm air or weltering ocean; not in the woods or fertile fields, nor among the birds that made the woods resonant with song, nor the animals that in the midst of plenty basked in the sunshine."
1,"His heart was simple like a child, unstained by arrogance or vanity."
1,"With sincerity and fervour he gave the required promise: as a pledge of continued favour, he received from his royal master a sum of money to defray pressing debts, and enable him to enter under good auspices his new career."
1,She never for a moment lost sight of her children.
1,"All delightful things, sublime scenery, soft breezes, exquisite music seemed to me associated with you and only through you to be pleasant to me."
1,But to return to dearer considerations.
1,"Left to myself, I strove with painful intensity to divine the motive of his request and foresee the events of the coming day."
1,"Soon after the festival she had sent for her child, and then she seemed to have forgotten us."
1,"Without the aid of servants, it was necessary to discharge all household duties; hands unused to such labour must knead the bread, or in the absence of flour, the statesmen or perfumed courtier must undertake the butcher's office."
1,"At the foot of this sublime chasm, a fertile laughing valley reached from sea to sea, and beyond was spread the blue Aegean, sprinkled with islands, the light waves glancing beneath the sun."
1,"The name of the king, he to whom my dying father had addressed his latest prayers, and who had barbarously slighted them, was associated only with the ideas of unkindness, injustice, and consequent resentment."
1,"She did not believe that he was dead, but she knew that he was in danger, and the hope of assisting in his liberation, and the idea of soothing by tenderness the ills that he might have undergone, elevated and harmonized the late jarring element of her being."
1,"But Clara was jealous of their services; she would be sole handmaid of Idris, sole minister to the wants of her little cousins; nothing gave her so much pleasure as our employing her in this way; she went beyond our desires, earnest, diligent, and unwearied, Abra was ready ere we called her name, And though we called another, Abra came."
1,"Let us go even where you will; the love that accompanies us will prevent our regrets."""
1,"He did not raise his, but after a short silence he replied to me in a low voice: ""You are indeed presumptuous, Mathilda, presumptuous and very rash."
1,All these circumstances were now related to Adrian and Idris.
1,"Happiness, love and peace, walked the forest paths, and tempered the atmosphere."
1,Such is the will of fate Such the decree of the High Ruler from whom there is no appeal: to whom I submit.
1,"""She was"", he said, ""the brightest vision that ever came upon the earth: there was somthing in her frank countenance, in her voice, and in every motion of her graceful form that overpowered me, as if it were a celestial creature that deigned to mingle with me in intercourse more sweet than man had ever before enjoyed."
1,At first his mother treated his theories as the wild ravings of inexperience.
1,"Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of this I murdered her."
1,"There was one man, he continued, who wished to alter all this, and bring us back to our days of impotence and contention: one man, who would dare arrogate the honour which was due to all who claimed England as their birthplace, and set his name and style above the name and style of his country."
1,This same evening his mother and sister arrived.
1,"""For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to cure the wound which I had received."
1,"The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted on his countenance."
1,"I strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well known form within. Oh With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might not intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that oppressed me, I wept aloud."
1,My countenance was painted with the hues of ill health and vexation.
1,"It is not by flying, but by facing the enemy, that we can conquer."
1,"""While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding place, I entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty."
1,I shewed her the dangers which her children incurred during her absence; and she at length agreed not to go beyond the inclosure of the forest.
1,"Do I fear, that my heart palpitates?"
1,But then Perdita thought more constantly of others than he; and part of her bashfulness arose from a wish to take from those around her a sense of inferiority; a feeling which never crossed her mind.

1,"Her own father had been an emigrant from another part of the country, and had died long since: they had no one relation to take them by the hand; they were outcasts, paupers, unfriended beings, to whom the most scanty pittance was a matter of favour, and who were treated merely as children of peasants, yet poorer than the poorest, who, dying, had left them, a thankless bequest, to the close handed charity of the land."
1,"The tender attachment that he bore me, and the love and veneration with which I returned it cast a charm over every moment."
1,"Then I would hasten to my desk, weave the new found web of mind in firm texture and brilliant colours, leaving the fashioning of the material to a calmer moment."

1,"Most men ruthlessly destroy the sacred veil, with which the female heart is wont to adorn the idol of its affections."
1,"A strange idea seized me; a person must have felt all the agonies of doubt concerning the life and death of one who is the whole world to them before they can enter into my feelings for in that state, the mind working unrestrained by the will makes strange and fanciful combinations with outward circumstances and weaves the chances and changes of nature into an immediate connexion with the event they dread."

1,You will weep but they will be tears of gentleness.
1,"The myrtle bushes, the thyme, the little cyclamen, which peep from the fissures of the rock, all the produce of the place, bear affinity to him; the light that invests the hills participates in his essence, and sky and mountains, sea and valley, are imbued by the presence of his spirit."
1,"I avoided my ancient comrades, and I soon lost them."
1,"She perished on the scaffold as a murderess From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my Elizabeth."

1,"By a strange fatality Juliet alone escaped, and she to the last waited on her relatives, and smoothed the pillow of death."

1,"Adrian was obliged to exert his utmost prudence, first to allay the discord, and then to provide for the multitude of the invaders."
1,"All was serene, burning, annihilating."
1,"At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast."
1,"To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return."

1,"Perdita, in whom ambition was a covered fire until she married Raymond, which event was for a time the fulfilment of her hopes; Perdita will rejoice in the glory and advancement of her lord and, coyly and prettily, not be discontented with her share."
1,"He has frequently conversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise."
1,I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain.

1,"He left me but I still was calm, and after I had saluted the starry sky and dewy earth with eyes of love and a contented good night, I slept sweetly, visited by dreams, the first of pleasure I had had for many long months."
1,I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition.

1,"Woe befall the day, she thought, woe, tears, and mourning betide the hour, that gave Raymond another hope than love, another wish than my devotion; and thrice joyful the moment when he shall be restored to me God knows, I put my trust in his vows, and believe his asserted faith but for that, I would not seek what I am now resolved to attain."

1,"I felt as if, from the order of the systematic world, I had plunged into chaos, obscure, contrary, unintelligible."
1,"By the application of praise, censure, and exhortation, she tried to seek and strike the fitting chords; and though the melody that followed her touch seemed discord to her, she built her hopes on his talents, and felt sure that she would at last win him."
1,"Strange system riddle of the Sphynx, most awe striking that thus man remains, while we the individuals pass away."
1,"Yet when she died Nay, then I was not miserable."
1,"""Common affection might have been satisfied with common usages."
1,"Agatha, the ever gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came."
1,"The fresh air revived me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their cottage."
1,"You were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind."

1,"He came each day to her abode of penury, and his presence transformed it to a temple redolent with sweets, radiant with heaven's own light; he partook of her delirium."
1,"Idris is a gentle, pretty, sweet little girl; it is impossible not to have an affection for her, and I have a very sincere one; only do not speak of love love, the tyrant and the tyrant queller; love, until now my conqueror, now my slave; the hungry fire, the untameable beast, the fanged snake no no I will have nothing to do with that love."

1,"We saw a great deal of society, and no day passed that my father did not endeavour to embellish by some new enjoyment."
1,"But to lose all to lose with life and love, glory also It shall not be ""I, and in a few brief years, all you, this panic struck army, and all the population of fair Greece, will no longer be."
1,"The air is empoisoned, and each human being inhales death, even while in youth and health, their hopes are in the flower."
1,"His enthusiasm for good which did not exist; his contempt for the sacredness of authority; his ardour and imprudence were all at the antipodes of the usual routine of life; the worldly feared him; the young and inexperienced did not understand the lofty severity of his moral views, and disliked him as a being different from themselves."
1,"O quickly bind up the wounds of the fallen let not one die; let not one more soul escape through your merciless gashes, to relate before the throne of God the tale of fratricide; bind up their wounds restore them to their friends."

1,"There was much kindness, gratitude, and sweetness in her expression, but no love."
1,"Ye who are linked by the affectionate ties of nature, companions, friends, lovers fathers, who toil with joy for their offspring; women, who while gazing on the living forms of their children, forget the pains of maternity; children, who neither toil nor spin, but love and are loved ""Oh, that death and sickness were banished from our earthly home that hatred, tyranny, and fear could no longer make their lair in the human heart that each man might find a brother in his fellow, and a nest of repose amid the wide plains of his inheritance that the source of tears were dry, and that lips might no longer form expressions of sorrow."
1,I now began to be human.
1,"We had receded from the crowd; and ascending the steps of the terrace, sought the Castle."
1,"Do so; if your high heart, incapable of my infirmity of purpose, refuses to bend to the lowness of mine."

1,"She was frightened by his gaiety, for she dreaded a greater revulsion at the end."
1,"These contemplations engaged her, when the voice of Raymond first struck her ear, a voice, once heard, never to be forgotten; she mastered her gush of feelings, and welcomed him with quiet gentleness."
1,"Seven years ago, in her youthful prime, she had become attached to him; he had served her country against the Turks; he had in her own land acquired that military glory peculiarly dear to the Greeks, since they were still obliged inch by inch to fight for their security."
1,"I threw the door forcibly open, as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared."

1,"Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt."
1,"He died in debt, and his little property was seized immediately by his creditors."
1,"It was now deep winter; it had snowed, and was still snowing; the wind whistled in the leafless trees, despoiling them of the white flakes as they fell; its drear moaning, and the continued knocking, mingled wildly with my dreams at length I was wide awake; hastily dressing myself, I hurried to discover the cause of this disturbance, and to open my door to the unexpected visitor."
1,"CHAPTER VII With a beating heart and fearful, I knew not why, I dismissed the servant and locking my door, sat down to read my father's letter."
1,"Before he went I used every argument, every persuasion to induce her to stop his journey."
1,"Adrian's soul was painted in his countenance, and concealment or deceit were at the antipodes to the dreadless frankness of his nature."
1,"About midnight I returned to the palace and sought Raymond; he was alone, and apparently composed; such composure, at least, was his as is inspired by a resolve to adhere to a certain line of conduct."

1,"I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like."
1,My passions are my masters; my smallest impulse my tyrant.
1,"Such was the depth of my emotion that I had no feeling of what caused my distress, my thoughts even wandered to many indifferent objects; but still neither moving limb or feature my tears fell untill, as if the fountains were exhausted, they gradually subsided, and I awoke to life as from a dream."
1,It keeps up a perpetual fever in my veins; it frets my immedicable wound; it is instinct with poison.
1,"All was uproar, crime, remorse and hate, yet still the tenderest love; and what first awoke me to the firm resolve of conquering my passion and of restoring her father to my child was the sight of your bitter and sympathizing sorrows."
1,"I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery."
1,"I feared no man, and loved none."
1,"It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles below."
1,My thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created.

1,"For a long time I dared not hope; but when his unobstructed breathing and the moisture that suffused his forehead, were tokens no longer to be mistaken of the departure of mortal malady, I ventured to whisper the news of the change to Idris, and at length succeeded in persuading her that I spoke truth."
1,Yet active life was the genuine soil for his virtues; and he sometimes suffered tedium from the monotonous succession of events in our retirement.
1,"He discovered the name of the spot whither my father had retreated, and where he died; he learnt the existence of his orphan children; and during the short interval between his arrival at Ulswater and our meeting in the park, he had been occupied in making inquiries concerning us, and arranging a variety of plans for our benefit, preliminary to his introducing himself to our notice."
1,I rambled away from them.

1,"Will you think of Raymond less at Windsor, the scene of your early happiness?"
1,"But this catalogue of favourites to be taken with us, could not be made without grief to think of our heavy losses, and a deep sigh for the many things we must leave behind."
1,"The arts of life, and the discoveries of science had augmented in a ratio which left all calculation behind; food sprung up, so to say, spontaneously machines existed to supply with facility every want of the population."
1,"We found Raymond in his dining room with six others: the bottle was being pushed about merrily, and had made considerable inroads on the understanding of one or two."
1,"The presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there."
1,The boys heard with childish glee of our removal: Clara asked if we were to go to Athens.
1,"In pursuance of this idea, he pushed open the door gently but the room was inhabited."
1,No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.

1,"""Yet, as I have said, I should be best pleased, at least for the present, to live under the same roof with you."
1,This was all accomplished even as I wished.
1,"When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon or the night was star light, I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage."

1,"His accent of bitter scorn thrilled me ""Do not tempt me to speak,"" he continued, ""my words would scare you in an universe of cowards I dare think among the church yard tombs among the victims of His merciless tyranny I dare reproach the Supreme Evil."
1,"""Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably."""
1,I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge.
1,"He,"" he continued, pointing to the corpse, ""he suffered not in the consummation of the deed."
1,"The sound of the waves was left behind; that of the multitude continued at intervals, supressed and hoarse; and though, in the city, the houses, churches, and public buildings were decorated with tapestry and banners though the soldiery lined the streets, and the inhabitants in thousands were assembled to give him hail, the same solemn silence prevailed, the soldiery presented arms, the banners vailed, many a white hand waved a streamer, and vainly sought to discern the hero in the vehicle, which, closed and encompassed by the city guards, drew him to the palace allotted for his abode."
1,They clung with eagerness to the hope held out that he might yet be alive.
1,"My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors."
1,"Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again."

1,"The peasants were shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding places to seek for prey."
1,"I heard of the death of only sons; of wives and husbands most devoted; of the rending of ties twisted with the heart's fibres, of friend losing friend, and young mothers mourning for their first born; and these moving incidents were grouped and painted in my mind by the knowledge of the persons, by my esteem and affection for the sufferers."
1,"Frankness and social feelings were the essence of Raymond's nature; without them his qualities became common place; without these to spread glory over his intercourse with Perdita, his vaunted exchange of a throne for her love, was as weak and empty as the rainbow hues which vanish when the sun is down."
1,"As we went he reminded me of what I was to say and do, yet, strange to say, I entered the chamber without having once reflected on my purpose."
1,She attended the markets she insisted upon being supplied with food for those who were too poor to purchase it.

1,"A silence prevailed, till one of the members coming to me, whispered that the Earl of Windsor had sent him word that I was to move his election, in the absence of the person who had been first chosen for this office."
1,"A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the following letter from Elizabeth: ""My dear Friend, ""It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may hope to see you in less than a fortnight."
1,"Chapter Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and I could not collect the courage to recommence my work."
1,I will not dwell on the last changes that I feel in the final decay of nature.
1,"The river swollen by autumnal rains, deluged the low lands, and Adrian in his favourite boat is employed in the dangerous pastime of plucking the topmost bough from a submerged oak."
1,"My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine."
1,One word I might speak and then you would be implicated in my destruction; yet that word is hovering on my lips.
1,"This benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress."
1,"On the second night after my release, I was again taken by the gamekeepers again imprisoned, and again released; and again, such was my pertinacity, did the fourth night find me in the forbidden park."
1,"She had at first yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety."
1,"The wind, prince of air, raged through his kingdom, lashing the sea into fury, and subduing the rebel earth into some sort of obedience."
1,They left me in an hour's time.
1,"It was a curious fact, that at this period, when by the marriage of Perdita I was allied to one of the richest individuals in England, and was bound by the most intimate friendship to its chiefest noble, I experienced the greatest excess of poverty that I had ever known."
1,Meanwhile all went on well in London.
1,"""She most of all,"" said Ernest, ""requires consolation; she accused herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched."
1,I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.
1,No youthful congregation of gallant hearted boys thronged the portal of the college; sad silence pervaded the busy school room and noisy playground.
1,"And when the development of her understanding disclosed the true nature of this intercourse to her, her affections were already engaged to her friend, and all she feared was lest other attractions and fickleness might make him break his infant vows."
1,Let him confide his misery to another heart and half the weight of it will be lightened.
1,No human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.
1,"Thus coming nearer and nearer each other, the howls and shouts of the Irish increased; the English proceeded in obedience to their officers, until they came near enough to distinguish the faces of their enemies; the sight inspired them with fury: with one cry, that rent heaven and was re echoed by the furthest lines, they rushed on; they disdained the use of the bullet, but with fixed bayonet dashed among the opposing foe, while the ranks opening at intervals, the matchmen lighted the cannon, whose deafening roar and blinding smoke filled up the horror of the scene."
1,"I devoted myself to him: imperfect creature that I was, I took myself to task, that I might become worthy of him."
1,"I drank in joy with life; my steps were light; my eyes, clear from the love that animated them, sought the heavens, and with my long hair loosened to the winds I gave my body and my mind to sympathy and delight."
1,"Still while I was near her, she could not be in utter despair she fully confided herself to me she did not seem to fear my death, or revert to its possibility; to my guardianship she consigned the full freight of her anxieties, reposing on my love, as a wind nipped fawn by the side of a doe, as a wounded nestling under its mother's wing, as a tiny, shattered boat, quivering still, beneath some protecting willow tree."
1,"This, O this may be the last time that you will surround me thus"" Abruptly she stopped, and then cried: ""What have I said?"
1,"With apparent calmness she discussed with me the probable spot where he might be found, and planned the means we should use for that purpose."
1,Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee?
1,"The English spirit awoke to its full activity, and, as it had ever done, set itself to resist the evil, and to stand in the breach which diseased nature had suffered chaos and death to make in the bounds and banks which had hitherto kept them out."
1,"Raymond could not resist these signs of distress: he felt perhaps somewhat ashamed of the part he acted of the injured man, he who was in truth the injurer."
1,"Memory brought madness with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and despondent."
1,"It was only when he was absent from me that his passion subdued him, that he clinched his hands knit his brows and with haggard looks called for death to his despair, raving wildly, untill exhausted he sank down nor was revived untill I joined him."
1,They were impatient and angry in the midst of terror.
1,"""A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter's apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours."
1,"I was from a thousand motives induced to attend minutely to the course of events, and watch each turn with intense anxiety."
1,"Thus often, pushing my way with difficulty through the narrow snow blocked town, I crossed the bridge and passed through Eton."
1,"And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections."
1,"Are you, then, so easily turned from your design?"
1,"Were the pride of ancestry, the patrician spirit, the gentle courtesies and refined pursuits, splendid attributes of rank, to be erased among us?"
1,"I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable."
1,Perhaps also my passion was lulled to content by the deep and exclusive affection you felt for me.
1,A shriek burst from the lips of the poor wretch; and then sudden motionlessness came over him; it was manifest to all that he was dead.
1,"Thus my father, born in affluence, and always prosperous, clombe without the difficulty and various disappointments that all human beings seem destined to encounter, to the very topmost pinacle of happiness: Around him was sunshine, and clouds whose shapes of beauty made the prospect divine concealed from him the barren reality which lay hidden below them."
1,"His intellect found sufficient field for exercise in his domestic circle, whose members, all adorned by refinement and literature, were many of them, like himself, distinguished by genius."
1,But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.
1,I was admitted within that sacred boundary which divides the intellectual and moral nature of man from that which characterizes animals.
1,"When any separation took place between us, it generally so happened, that Idris and Perdita would ramble away together, and we remained to discuss the affairs of nations, and the philosophy of life."
1,"I dared not die, but I might feign death, and thus escape from my comforters: they will believe me united to my father, and so indeed I shall be."
1,"He died embracing the sod, which was piled above his breast, when he was placed beside the beings whom he regretted with such wild despair."
1,It will contain no reproaches.
1,The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature.
1,"After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey."
1,"Your own delicacy will not allow you, I am convinced, to attempt to trace me."
1,"I ought to have familiarized the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have been prepared for my approach."
1,"Deeds of heroism also occurred, whose very mention swells the heart and brings tears into the eyes."
1,Posterity became my heirs.
1,But we have been placed here and bid live and hope.
1,"The veil must be thicker than that invented by Turkish jealousy; the wall higher than the unscaleable tower of Vathek, which should conceal from her the workings of his heart, and hide from her view the secret of his actions."
1,The contest was keen and doubtful.
1,To England and to Englishmen I dedicate myself.
1,"Several days elapsed, and at last an answer came, dated from Cologne."
1,"On returning through the lane, I saw at a distance the same assemblage of persons which I had left."
1,"One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and that was sufficient for me."
1,What is there in our nature that is for ever urging us on towards pain and misery?
1,"""You begin late,"" said I, ironically, ""marriage is usually considered the grave, and not the cradle of love."
1,"September th A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot forbear recording it."
1,This was the only cloud in the azure of her happiness.
1,"He was seldom at the palace; never, but when he was assured that his public duties would prevent his remaining alone with Perdita."
1,"When she again lived, it was only to weep and sigh."
1,Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.
1,"Her passions had subdued her appetites, even her natural wants; she slept little, and hardly ate at all; her body was evidently considered by her as a mere machine, whose health was necessary for the accomplishment of her schemes, but whose senses formed no part of her enjoyment."
1,"If you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied."
1,"The accounts furnished him, however distorted, of a great and wise nation asserting its right to govern itself, excited his admiration: in early days he became a republican from principle."
1,When others were there he often spoke to me and his eyes perpetually followed my slightest motion.
1,"The spirit of superstition had birth, from the wreck of our hopes, and antics wild and dangerous were played on the great theatre, while the remaining particle of futurity dwindled into a point in the eyes of the prognosticators."
1,"Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate."
1,"And what is each human being worth, if he do not put forth his strength to aid his fellow creatures?"
1,"All events, at the same time that they deeply interested me, arranged themselves in pictures before me."
1,"Time shall rob me of the graces of maturity, shall take the fire from my eyes, and agility from my limbs, shall steal the better part of life, eager expectation and passionate love, and shower them in double portion on thy dear head."
1,Life was then brilliant; I began to learn to hope and what brings a more bitter despair to the heart than hope destroyed?
1,"Soon we returned to shore, and I endeavoured to obviate the impression made on the child's mind, by treating Raymond's fears lightly."
1,"During the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened frame."
1,"On this occasion, my sister was not alone; nor could I fail to recognise her companion: it was Idris, the till now unseen object of my mad idolatry."
1,"As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate."
1,"The God sends down his angry plagues from high, Famine and pestilence in heaps they die."
1,"She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent farewell."
1,"As I waited for the carriage I walked up and down with a quick pace; then kneeling and passionately clasping my hands I tried to pray but my voice was choked by convulsive sobs Oh the sun shone, the air was balmy he must yet live for if he were dead all would surely be black as night to me The motion of the carriage knowing that it carried me towards him and that I might perhaps find him alive somewhat revived my courage: yet I had a dreadful ride."
1,"Yet I own, that considering the task which Raymond had taken on himself as Protector of England, and the cares to which it became him to attend, I was exceedingly provoked to observe the worthless fellows on whom his time was wasted, and the jovial if not drunken spirit which seemed on the point of robbing him of his better self."
1,Idris had shared Perdita's ill opinion of the Greek; but Raymond's account softened and interested her.
1,"When we arrived at Kishan, we learnt, that on hearing of the advance of Lord Raymond and his detachment, the Turkish army had retreated from Rodosto; but meeting with a reinforcement, they had re trod their steps."
1,"She would see Raymond, since destiny had led him to her, and her constancy and devotion must merit his friendship."
1,"Happy, happy earth Fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome."
1,This determination soothed me.
1,"I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight."
1,The last words of Evadne were the seal upon the warrant of my death.
1,"high aspirations cause the flow of my blood; my eyes seem to penetrate the cloudy midnight of time, and to discern within the depths of its darkness, the fruition of all my soul desires."
1,"Besides, she had memories of past tenderness to cherish, smiles, words, and even tears, to con over, which, though remembered in desertion and sorrow, were to be preferred to the forgetfulness of the grave."
1,"You have given me new wants and now your trifle with me as if my heart were as whole as yours, as if I were not in truth a shorn lamb thrust out on the bleak hill side, tortured by every blast."
1,"But we must live, and not act our lives; pursuing the shadow, I lost the reality now I renounce both."
1,"I HAVE lingered thus long on the extreme bank, the wasting shoal that stretched into the stream of life, dallying with the shadow of death."
1,"The forest glades, the ferny dells, and lawny uplands, the cultivated and cheerful country spread around the silver pathway of ancient Thames, all earth, air, and wave, took up one choral voice, inspired by memory, instinct with plaintive regret."
1,"Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth."
1,"At all events methought that the wound could be healed; and, if they remained together, it would be so."
1,"The fields had been left uncultivated, weeds and gaudy flowers sprung up, or where a few wheat fields shewed signs of the living hopes of the husbandman, the work had been left halfway, the ploughman had died beside the plough; the horses had deserted the furrow, and no seedsman had approached the dead; the cattle unattended wandered over the fields and through the lanes; the tame inhabitants of the poultry yard, baulked of their daily food, had become wild young lambs were dropt in flower gardens, and the cow stalled in the hall of pleasure."
1,"He found my name a good passport to preferment, and he had procured for me the situation of private secretary to the Ambassador at Vienna, where I should enter on my career under the best auspices."
1,"""On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood."
1,"They planted the cannon on the tumuli, sole elevations in this level country, and formed themselves into column and hollow square; while the pioneers threw up small mounds for their protection."
1,Then on his word and will depended my own happiness the fate of all dear to me.
1,"It was necessary that I should return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous."
1,"you could not hope to conquer, and yet you gave me the pain of a triumph over my dearest friend."""
1,"At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul's towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history."
1,It requires more philosophy than I possess to bear this injustice with patience.
1,"The few members who were present, had come more for the sake of terminating the business by securing a legal attendance, than under the idea of a debate."
1,"Then we were as gay as summer insects, playful as children; we ever met one another with smiles, and read content and joy in each other's countenances."
1,I had imposed a law of silence on myself; and for months I have kept it.
1,I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks.
1,"""My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense."
1,"Sometimes she remembered that she had suffered keen anguish, when he hesitated in his choice."
1,"My heart was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale."
1,"To night the question is to be decided, as there is a call of the house for the purpose."
1,"This spirit gave a tone of irresistible persuasion to his intercourse with others, so that he seemed like an inspired musician, who struck, with unerring skill, the ""lyre of mind,"" and produced thence divine harmony."
1,"She seated herself then on the same ottoman where I had left her in the morning resting on the beating heart of her Raymond; I dared not approach her, but sat at a distant corner, watching her starting and nervous gestures."
1,"Encouraged by this encomium, I proceeded, in answer to his inquiries, to relate what I remembered of my parent; and he gave an account of those circumstances which had brought about a neglect of my father's testamentary letter."
1,"This reflection unwrinkled my brow, and I could feel and I wept to feel it a half melancholy smile draw from my lips their expression of suffering: I dared indulge better hopes for my future life; years must pass but they would speed lightly away winged by hope, or if they passed heavily, still they would pass and I had not lost my father for ever."
1,"He, the noble, the warlike, the great in every quality that can adorn the mind and person of man; he is fitted to be the Protector of England."
1,Thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.
1,"But again when I reflected that they had spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects."
1,Why am I to give an account of myself?
1,"I could not see her thus lost, without exerting myself to remedy the evil remediless I knew, if I could not in the end bring her to reconcile herself to Raymond."
1,He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance.
1,The very memory half unmans me.
1,"""As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth."
1,"Thus perhaps as the sensation of immediate suffering wore off, I became more human."
1,"His serious mien recalled, by some association, the half forgotten Evadne to my mind, and I seized this opportunity to make enquiries from him concerning her strange lot."
1,I passed the night wretchedly.
1,"Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due."
1,"Poor William he was our darling and our pride"" Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother's eyes; a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame."
1,"They did not appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous."
1,"Yet, as he had lived on for months nearly in the same state, he did not inspire us with any immediate fear; and, though he talked of death as an event most familiar to his thoughts, he did not cease to exert himself to render others happy, or to cultivate his own astonishing powers of mind."
1,Among some these changes produced a devotion and sacrifice of self at once graceful and heroic.
1,I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate.
1,"""'They are kind they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me."
1,"If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind."
1,He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.
1,"If dishonour, or what I conceive to be dishonour, come near me, I am lost."""
1,Justine shook her head mournfully.
1,"Soon after Idris, who was at the harp, turned to that passionate and sorrowful air in Figaro, ""Porgi, amor, qualche risforo,"" in which the deserted Countess laments the change of the faithless Almaviva."
1,I left London in a small vessel bound for a port in the north of England.
1,He asked me the history of my earlier years.
1,"""I expected this,"" cried Perdita; ""I supposed that you would treat me as a mad, foolish girl."
1,"Horrible, most horrible I veil my eyes in terror of the change, and gushing tears bear witness to my sympathy for this unimaginable ruin."
1,"One man's life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race."
1,"Our enemy, like the Calamity of Homer, trod our hearts, and no sound was echoed from her steps With ills the land is rife, with ills the sea, Diseases haunt our frail humanity, Through noon, through night, on casual wing they glide, Silent, a voice the power all wise denied."
1,"From your lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.' ""'May I know the names and residence of those friends?' ""I paused."
1,"I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings."
1,"""Nevertheless, I will try it,"" said my companion; ""it may lead to the real cavern."
1,We came at last to the road that led to the town of and at an inn there we heard that my father had passed by somewhat before sunset; he had observed the approaching storm and had hired a horse for the next town which was situated a mile from the sea that he might arrive there before it should commence: this town was five miles off.
1,"Man cannot repose, and his restless aspirations will now bring forth good instead of evil."
1,Raymond then lamented the cureless evil of his situation with Perdita.
1,She knew that Raymond had conversed with her; had he instigated this request?
1,Our rate could not have been less than eight knots.
1,"Shall two years more be thus passed, each day adding to our alienation, each act being another stone piled on the barrier which separates us?"
1,"""Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage."
1,"My sister was struck by my narrative: ""How beyond the imagination of man,"" she exclaimed, ""are the decrees of heaven, wondrous and inexplicable"" ""Foolish girl,"" cried Raymond angrily, ""are you like my valiant soldiers, panic struck?"
1,Methought this was but a poor expedient; but I assured him of my obedience and zeal.
1,"I understand your feeling,"" continued he, perceiving that I wished to interrupt him; ""but you are mistaken, my friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined."""
1,"It required hands stronger than mine; stronger I do believe than any human force to break the thick, adamantine chain that has bound me, once breathing nothing but joy, ever possessed by a warm love delight in goodness, to misery only to be ended, and now about to be ended, in death."
1,"I returned to Windsor at the wish of Idris, who seemed to think that there was greater safety for her children at that spot; and because, once having taken on me the guardianship of the district, I would not desert it while an inhabitant survived."
1,"Perhaps there was besides a lurking dislike to bind herself in the face of the world to one whom she did not love not love, at least, with that passionate enthusiasm which her heart told her she might one day feel towards another."
1,"I smiled with quiet joy; and in my thoughts, which through long habit would for ever connect themselves into one train, as if I shaped them into words, I thus addressed the scene before me: ""I salute thee, beautiful Sun, and thou, white Earth, fair and cold Perhaps I shall never see thee again covered with green, and the sweet flowers of the coming spring will blossom on my grave."
1,I was born in England.
1,"Locked in his embrace, she spoke thus, and cast back her head, seeking an assent to her words in his eyes they were sparkling with ineffable delight."
1,"Nature was the same, as when she was the kind mother of the human race; now, childless and forlorn, her fertility was a mockery; her loveliness a mask for deformity."
1,He was pacing the garden: his passions were in a state of inconceivable turbulence.
1,"The sight of her, in her present situation, passed like an arrow into his soul."
1,"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self."
1,"Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be restored to my family in peace and happiness."
1,"When it seemed destined that all were to die, we were reckless of the how and when now that the virulence of the disease was mitigated, and it appeared willing to spare some, each was eager to be among the elect, and clung to life with dastard tenacity."
1,"At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity."
1,"There was an air of anxiety, sometimes of terror in the new comers, strongly contrasted with the resigned and even satisfied mien of those who had had audience."
1,It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.
1,"There were no carriages, and grass had sprung high in the streets; the houses had a desolate look; most of the shutters were closed; and there was a ghast and frightened stare in the persons I met, very different from the usual business like demeanour of the Londoners."
1,"I had determined, if you were going southwards, still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose."
1,"Her native sprightliness needed no undue excitement, and her placid heart reposed contented on my love, the well being of her children, and the beauty of surrounding nature."
1,She looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal.
1,"Cherishing the most fervent hopes, embarked on the waste ocean, we saw with delight the receding shore of Britain, and on the wings of desire outspeeded our well filled sails towards the South."
1,The sight of it soothed her.
1,"""When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection."
1,A man of this kind was now pouring forth his eloquent despair among the inhabitants of Windsor.
1,"""I have lost that which adorned and dignified my life; that which linked me to other men."
1,"""'Where do these friends reside?' ""'Near this spot.'"
1,"Among them the Greek army was encamped, and their squadrons moved to and fro now in regular march, now in swift career."
1,"Shall I meet you again, after having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa or America?"
1,It soon became known that Adrian took great delight in his park and preserves.
1,"With such schooling did my poor Idris try to hush thronging fears, and in some measure succeeded."
1,"I afterwards learned that, knowing my father's advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder."
1,Suddenly I became as it were the father of all mankind.
1,At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude.
1,"I was hurt by the careless tone with which he conveyed this information, and replied coldly: ""I am obliged to you for your intelligence, and will avail myself of it."""
1,"There was so much of truth and nature in his resentment, that her doubts were dispelled."
1,"During the first months of his Protectorate, Raymond and she had been inseparable; each project was discussed with her, each plan approved by her."
1,"No man can tell there is no refuge on earth, it comes on us like a thousand packs of wolves we must all fly where shall you go?"
1,"""What if some little payne the passage have That makes frayle flesh to fear the bitter wave?"
1,In obedience to my request Perdita detailed the melancholy circumstances that led to this event.
1,It was curious that even little Clara observed this law towards her mother.
1,"She threw open her window, which looked on the palace garden."
1,The mutual link of our destinies is broken; we must be divided by seas by land.
1,"I am, however, in good spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them."
1,The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact.
1,"Death is the goal that I would attain, but, alas I do not even see the end of the course."
1,"You must not shut me from all communion with you: do not tell me why you grieve but only say the words, ""I am unhappy,"" and you will feel relieved as if for some time excluded from all intercourse by some magic spell you should suddenly enter again the pale of human sympathy."
1,"Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time."""
1,"Evadne was two years older than Adrian; and who, at eighteen, ever loved one so much their junior?"
1,"Towards evening dark thunder clouds arose above the horrizon and I heard its distant roll after sunset they darkened the whole sky and it began to rain, the lightning lighted up the whole country and the thunder drowned the noise of our carriage."
1,"""And you escaped?"" ""No, but I recovered."""
1,"I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places."
1,"The entrance of Macbeth did not destroy the illusion, for he was actuated by the same feelings that inspired us, and while the work of magic proceeded we sympathized in his wonder and his daring, and gave ourselves up with our whole souls to the influence of scenic delusion."
1,"Adrian's countenance flitted across, tainted by death Idris, with eyes languidly closed and livid lips, was about to slide into the wide grave."
1,But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited the professors.
1,"I would not yield, but to the last gasp resolutely defended my dear ones against sorrow and pain; and if I were vanquished at last, it should not be ingloriously."
1,"Two o'clock struck, after which none were admitted; those who had been disappointed went sullenly or sorrowfully away, while I entered the audience chamber."
1,"Why should our dwelling place be so lovely, and why should the instincts of nature minister pleasurable sensations?"
1,Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke?
1,"How few in youth's prime, moor their vessels on the ""golden sands,"" and collect the painted shells that strew them."
1,"His name as Protector was the burthen of every tongue; his achievements, projects, and magnificence, the argument of every story."
1,"There were still a few hackney coaches accustomed to stand about the streets, more truly from habit than for use."
1,"The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love."
1,But the task imposed on Perdita was not the less painful.
1,"Come, as you have played Despair with me I will play the part of Una with you and bring you hurtless from his dark cavern."
1,All Athens accompanied us for several miles.
1,"The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me."
1,At this time Lord Raymond returned from Greece.
1,"Among a race of independent, and generous, and well educated men, in a country where the imagination is empress of men's minds, there needs be no fear that we should want a perpetual succession of the high born and lordly."
1,"Cast away the hearts of tigers that burn in your breasts; throw down those tools of cruelty and hate; in this pause of exterminating destiny, let each man be brother, guardian, and stay to the other."
1,"In spite of resentment, by day and night she figured to herself the toils and dangers of the wanderers."
1,She devoted herself to the study of her son's disposition.
1,"Her timidity was not artificial, but arose from that fear of not being properly appreciated, that slight estimation of the neglect of the world, which also characterized Raymond."
1,"Others perceived only a passing casualty; they endeavoured to exchange terror for heedlessness, and plunged into licentiousness, to avoid the agonizing throes of worst apprehension."
1,"We are neither cowards nor fatalists; but, believing that God has placed the means for our preservation in our own hands, we will use those means to our utmost."
1,"I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans of their subsequent degenerating of the decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings."
1,"She listened eagerly to him, yet tantalized herself by giving to his words a meaning foreign to their true interpretation, and adverse to her hopes."
1,"Explanation You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain?"
1,And yet I dared not request him to use his influence that I might obtain an honourable provision for myself for then I should have been obliged to leave Windsor.
1,"The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the door was off its hinges."
1,"Never, Idris related, did the angry lady deign to recur to gentleness and persuasion; if she had, the task of resistance would have been exquisitely painful."
1,"""Yes,"" said Elizabeth, ""I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone."""
1,"One of his servants, while waiting on him, had suddenly fallen down dead."
1,"Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features."
1,"It required all her self command, to suppress the gush of tears self pity caused at this idea."
1,"Friendship, hand in hand with admiration, tenderness and respect, built a bower of delight in my heart, late rough as an untrod wild in America, as the homeless wind or herbless sea."
1,"He transacted public business with distaste, and hastened from it to the solitude which was at once his bane and relief."
1,"There was a companionship in suffering there, and, the neighbours keeping constant watch on each other, and inspired by the active benevolence of Adrian, succour was afforded, and the path of destruction smoothed."
1,The talents and courage of Raymond were highly esteemed among the Greeks.
1,"His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow?"
1,"I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved."
1,"In Greece I had learnt to love him; his very waywardness, and self abandonment to the impulses of superstition, attached me to him doubly; it might be weakness, but it was the antipodes of all that was grovelling and selfish."
1,The physician declared that he died of the plague.
1,"Whatever those might be which descended to me, my noble young friend resolved should not be lost for want of culture."
1,"In spite of her coldness and long absence, he welcomed her with sensibility, displaying such affection as sought to heal the wounds of pride and sorrow, and was repulsed only by her total apparent want of sympathy."
1,"He dismissed his servants there, only telling them that he had a sudden call of business and that they were to obey me as their mistress untill his return."
1,"The English for the most part talked of Thrace and Macedonia, as they would of a lunar territory, which, unknown to them, presented no distinct idea or interest to the minds."
1,"During our stay at Naples, we often returned to this cave, sometimes alone, skimming the sun lit sea, and each time added to our store."
1,She herself would disdain my interference.
1,Tragedies deep and dire were the chief favourites.
1,"When I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms."
1,"The music died away, the shouts abruptly ended; the soldiers had cleared a space in which a carriage was drawn up."
1,The very danger drew them closer.
1,"He talked of general subjects, and gave me ideas I had never before conceived."
1,"Is not love a divinity, because it is immortal?"
1,"Whatever I was about to reply, was interrupted by the powerful emotions of Clara."
1,"There is something terribly appalling in our situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me."
1,"The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber."
1,"I called aloud for him through the darkness of night, over the scorching ruins of fallen Constantinople, his name was heard; no voice replied echo even was mute."
1,And thus the ill starred girl died a victim to my senseless rashness.
1,"But an earthquake had changed the scene under our very feet the earth yawned deep and precipitous the gulph below opened to receive us, while the hours charioted us towards the chasm."
1,"I watched over my hasty temper, subdued my burning impatience of character, schooled my self engrossing thoughts, educating myself to the best perfection I might attain, that the fruit of my exertions might be his happiness."
1,"Relations of what he had done, conjectures concerning his future actions, were the never failing topics of the hour."
1,"""Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you."""
1,"But the overflowing misery I now felt, and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion."
1,"Raymond did not wonder, that, thus situated, the artist had shrunk from notice, but he did not for this alter his resolve."
1,"Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn."
1,"Disappointment and sickness have hitherto held dominion over me; twin born with me, my would, was for ever enchained by the shall not, of these my tyrants."
1,There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a natural talent.
1,The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room.
1,"I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should soon see Geneva."
1,"He also gave me the list of books which I had requested, and I took my leave."
1,"I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale fishing."
1,"The wind arose; the sea roared; and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound."
1,Now I am twenty eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen.
1,Even now if we had courage we might be free.
1,"Such was the power of man over the elements; a power long sought, and lately won; yet foretold in by gone time by the prince of poets, whose verses I quoted much to the astonishment of my pilot, when I told him how many hundred years ago they had been written: Oh human wit, thou can'st invent much ill, Thou searchest strange arts: who would think by skill, An heavy man like a light bird should stray, And through the empty heavens find a way?"
1,"The labour necessary to bring the lands to this sort of culture, employed and fed the offcasts of the diminished manufactories."
1,"She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise."
1,"This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my hands, and exclaimed aloud, ""William, dear angel this is thy funeral, this thy dirge"" As I said these words, I perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken."
1,Leave the task of persuasion on that point to me; I do not ask you to assist me there.
1,"He seemed born anew, and virtue, more potent than Medean alchemy, endued him with health and strength."
1,"But though impenetrably veiled from him, his public office permitted her to become acquainted with all his actions, his daily course of life, even his conversation."
1,"Until now, my savage habits had done me no radical mischief; my physical powers had grown up and flourished under their influence, and my mind, undergoing the same discipline, was imbued with all the hardy virtues."
1,This was a glorious winter.
1,"I had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and ignorantly I had repined."
1,"My mother, pennyless and burthened with two children, waited week after week, and month after month, in sickening expectation of a reply, which never came."
1,"The porter opened the gates of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my view."
1,"The moment Adrian should be legally elected his deputy, he would escape to safety."
1,"He was not materially hurt, a little fresh water soon recovered him."
1,"The evil is come home to us, and we must not shrink from our fate."
1,This change was particularly agreeable to me.
1,"""Elizabeth Lavenza ""Geneva, May th, "" This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of the fiend ""I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT"" Such was my sentence, and on that night would the daemon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings."
1,I felt as if I were placed under a ban as if I had no right to claim their sympathies as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them.
1,"I gasped for breath ""I will not detail to you,"" continued Raymond, ""the melancholy particulars."
1,"Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my younger children."
1,"Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly."
1,"""For my part,"" said I, ""I am too well convinced of the worth of our friend, and the rich harvest of benefits that all England would reap from his Protectorship, to deprive my countrymen of such a blessing, if he consent to bestow it on them."""
1,"The sight of the military restored hope to those who fled, and revenge took place of fear."
1,"I found this vision of beauty in Perdita's alcove, in earnest conversation with its inmate."
1,"He came up the while; and his appearance blew aside, with gentle western breath, my cloudy wrath: a tall, slim, fair boy, with a physiognomy expressive of the excess of sensibility and refinement stood before me; the morning sunbeams tinged with gold his silken hair, and spread light and glory over his beaming countenance."
1,"If I were alone, would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress?"
1,"The labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind."""
1,"She had not even the same advantage as I in the recollection of her parents; she clung to me, her brother, as her only friend, but her alliance with me completed the distaste that her protectors felt for her; and every error was magnified by them into crimes."
1,"I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.'"
1,"Not one of her relations, for they lay glaring on her with stony eyes."
1,"Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments."
1,I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.
1,The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder.
1,"Her servant, however, remained with her."
1,"Even Adrian was obliged in part to yield, that he might be able, if not to guide, at least to set bounds to the license of the times."
1,"The apartments were restored to their pristine splendour, and the park, all disrepairs restored, was guarded with unusual care."
1,"Look in that mirror; when I came your brow was contracted, your eyes deep sunk in your head, your lips quivering; your hands trembled violently when I took them; but now all is tranquil and soft."
1,"""Be assured, sir,"" said he, ""no pains or exertions on my part shall be spared to discover the villain."""
1,"Beneath the shades of night, and through the day, whose garish light displays our solitude, thou wilt still be at my side, and even Windsor will not be regretted."""
1,"My labours have cheered long hours of solitude, and taken me out of a world, which has averted its once benignant face from me, to one glowing with imagination and power."
1,"And then I wept; yes, warm tears once more struggled into my eyes soothing yet bitter; and after I had wept much and called with unavailing anguish, with outstretched arms, for my cruel father; after my weak frame was exhausted by all variety of plaint I sank once more into reverie, and once more reflected on how I might find that which I most desired; dear to me if aught were dear, a death like solitude."
1,"""Last Thursday May th, I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to walk in Plainpalais."
1,"""My father left it Where is he?"
1,"Above all, the anxious mother, my own beloved and drooping Idris, claimed my earnest care; I could not reproach the anxiety that never for a moment slept in her heart, but I exerted myself to distract her attention from too keen an observation of the truth of things, of the near and nearer approaches of disease, misery, and death, of the wild look of our attendants as intelligence of another and yet another death reached us; for to the last something new occurred that seemed to transcend in horror all that had gone before."
1,"Love, and her child, Hope, which can bestow wealth on poverty, strength on the weak, and happiness on the sorrowing."
1,"One word, in truth, had alarmed her more than battles or sieges, during which she trusted Raymond's high command would exempt him from danger."
1,"Not so with us, the remnant."
1,"He pointed out the errors, and the alterations that he wished to be made; he offered the Greek a pencil that he might correct the sketch on the spot; this was refused by his visitor, who said that he perfectly understood, and would work at it at home."
1,"As he spoke, every sound was hushed, every thought suspended by intense attention."
1,"The same peculiarities of character rendered her sorrows agonies; her fancy magnified them, her sensibility made her for ever open to their renewed impression; love envenomed the heart piercing sting."
1,"He who sat near Raymond was telling a story, which convulsed the rest with laughter."
1,"But this account, which might as properly belong to a former period of my life as to the present moment, leads me far afield."
1,My own heart was racked by regrets and remorse.
1,"He could not really care for me, I thought, for if he did the storm would rather have made him come even if I had not expected him, than, as it did, prevent a promised visit."
1,"Our Lazzeroni bore flaring torches, which shone red, and almost dusky, in the murky subterranean passages, whose darkness thirstily surrounding them, seemed eager to imbibe more and more of the element of light."
1,"Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror."
1,"Chapter ""Cursed, cursed creator Why did I live?"
1,"Man You may hate, but beware Your hours will pass in dread and misery, and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness forever."
1,"The evil was so wide spreading, so violent and immedicable, that no care, no prevention could be judged superfluous, which even added a chance to our escape."
1,"But Adrian read with uncertain aim the charactery of her face, and might mistake."
1,"I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame."
1,"The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned."
1,"Born at Athens, that city claimed him for her own, and by giving him the command of her peculiar division in the army, the commander in chief only possessed superior power."
1,"The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese."
1,"I was sitting by my fire, the physician who had attended me ever since my fever had just left me, and I looked over his prescription in which digitalis was the prominent medecine."
1,"I was indifferent, therefore, to my school fellows in general; but I united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them."
1,"I hired men to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise."
1,"Such an one was near, hovering round this house."
1,But he found that a traveller's life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments.
1,"Still I would not hurry on; I would pause for ever on the recollections of these happy weeks; I would repeat every word, and how many do I remember, record every enchantment of the faery habitation."
1,"If you can never be happy, can you never bestow happiness?"
1,"I met troops of horses, herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, wandering at will; here throwing down a hay rick, and nestling from cold in its heart, which afforded them shelter and food there having taken possession of a vacant cottage."
1,"Go, Devoted One, and return thus This is my curse, a daughter's curse: go, and return pure to thy child, who will never love aught but thee."
1,Idris endeavoured to persuade her to remain.
1,"I had before been moved by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race."
1,"I have no one near me, gentle yet courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans."
1,"She looked on it as a deceitful dream, and tried to throw off the consciousness of it; but like the shirt of Nessus, it clung to her very flesh, and ate with sharp agony into her vital principle."
1,Farewell I must now leave you for a few hours.
1,"As he spoke, I felt subject to him; and all my boasted pride and strength were subdued by the honeyed accents of this blue eyed boy."
1,"Still she felt sure that he would come at last; and the wider the breach might appear at this crisis, the more secure she was of closing it for ever."
1,"What all my pretty chickens, and their dam, At one fell swoop A pang of tameless grief wrenched every heart, a burst of despair was echoed from every lip."
1,"But everteeming Nature will create another and another, and thou wilt loose nought by my destruction."
1,"The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary."
1,"""I spent the winter in this manner."
1,"Alas I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all?"
1,"One sheet of white covered it, while bitter recollection told me that cold as the winter clothed earth, were the hearts of the inhabitants."
1,"I took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how."
1,"A great part of these grounds had been given to cultivation, and strips of potatoe land and corn were scattered here and there."
1,"Our nature dim, like to an unlighted torch, sleeps in formless blank till the fire attain it; this life of life, this light to moon, and glory to the sun."
1,Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice.
1,"There were women weeping around; I hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause."
1,Perdita grew in beauty and excellence under his eye; I no longer recognised my reserved abstracted sister in the fascinating and open hearted wife of Raymond.
1,"Whence but from ingratitude, from falsehood, from a dereliction on the part of the prince's father, of all noble sympathy and generous feeling."
1,"I am glad now to feel the current of thought flow through my mind, as the blood through the articulations of my frame; mere existence is pleasure; and I thank God that I live ""And all ye happy nurslings of mother earth, do ye not echo my words?"
1,"The nature of Perdita was less perfect; but tenderness and happiness improved her temper, and softened her natural reserve."
1,"If we traversed a mountain, Greece, a living map, was spread beneath, her renowned pinnacles cleaving the ether; her rivers threading in silver line the fertile land."
1,These are the words that it contained.
1,"No voice was heard telling us to hold When foreign distresses came to be felt by us through the channels of commerce, we set ourselves to apply remedies."
1,"I beseech you; by your former love for me now lost, I adjure you to answer that one question."
1,"Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind."
1,"I lost sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk."
1,"I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say, ""Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness."
1,The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills.
1,"Alas for these latter days The world had grown old, and all its inmates partook of the decrepitude."
1,Does it now only exist in my memory?
1,"The same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion."
1,He personated his assumption of innocence even to self deception.
1,"Nor did her angry dislike prevent Adrian from imaging my father, as he had said, the type of all that was gallant, amiable, and fascinating in man."
1,"One of my first acts for the recovery even of my own composure, was to bid farewell to the sea."
1,"Such is human nature, that beauty and deformity are often closely linked."
1,"""You will ask me,"" continued Evadne, ""what I have done since; why I have not applied for succour to the rich Greeks resident here; why I have not returned to my native country?"
1,In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.
1,"Come, come, the worst is past: no more grief, tears or despair; were not those the words you uttered?"
1,My passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them.
1,"If infection depended upon the air, the air was subject to infection."
1,"Tell me, Lionel, do you consent that I should marry this young lady?"""
1,"On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of these was vacant when I arrived."
1,"She replied with earnestness, ""I do not refuse to believe you, Raymond; on the contrary I promise to put implicit faith in your simple word."
1,Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay?
1,"I trod air; no doubt, no fear, no hope even, disturbed me; I clasped with my soul the fulness of contentment, satisfied, undesiring, beatified."
1,"""Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of meeting with him."
1,"I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man."
1,"They shall go down together to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust Yes my hope was corruption and dust and all to which death brings us."
1,"Strange to say the result perhaps of the concussion of air occasioned by the blowing up of the city huge, white thunder clouds lifted themselves up from the southern horizon, and gathered over head; they were the first blots on the blue expanse that I had seen for months, and amidst this havoc and despair they inspired pleasure."
1,"My soul is a fading spark, my nature frail as a spent wave; but I dedicate all of intellect and strength that remains to me, to that one work, and take upon me the task, as far as I am able, of bestowing blessings on my fellow men"" His voice trembled, his eyes were cast up, his hands clasped, and his fragile person was bent, as it were, with excess of emotion."
1,Yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection?
1,"Each long hour was counted, and ""He suffers"" was the burthen of all her thoughts."
1,"She would not consent to this proposition, but as soon as she had arranged the affairs which her brother's departure had caused to fall to her care, she quitted England and took me with her to her scotch estate."
1,I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.
1,I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh.
1,I am malicious because I am miserable.
1,I expressed these feelings in my answer.
1,"To be present at the election of a Protector, and to give our yea or nay for his shuffling Grace of ? or for that noisy Ryland?"
1,"I might tell it to the winds and to the desart heaths but I must never among my fellow creatures, either by word or look give allowance to the smallest conjecture of the dread reality: I must shrink before the eye of man lest he should read my father's guilt in my glazed eyes: I must be silent lest my faltering voice should betray unimagined horrors."
1,"I am quite weary of enduring the misery which hourly I do endure, and I will throw it off."
1,"Yet sorrow only slept to revive more fierce, but love never woke again its ghost, ever hovering over my father's grave, alone survived since his death all the world was to me a blank except where woe had stampt its burning words telling me to smile no more the living were not fit companions for me, and I was ever meditating by what means I might shake them all off, and never be heard of again."
1,He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky.
1,"Falsehood and artifice are in themselves so hateful, that, though I still thought I did right, a feeling of shame and guilt came painfully upon me."
1,Had my eyes deceived me?
1,"Snow fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not."
1,"Their pronunciation was quick, and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference."
1,He was a boy of singular talent and fancy.
1,"Never was she so enchanting as at this time, when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us."
1,"And all this, to be sure, was delicately put; not in broad words for my feelings might be hurt but Whispered so and so In dark hint soft and lowE with downcast eyes, and sympathizing smiles or whimpers; and I listened with quiet countenance while every nerve trembled; I that dared not utter aye or no to all this blasphemy."
1,"He seemed incapable of conceiving of the full extent of the power that selfishness vice possesses in the world: when I knew him, although he had suffered disappointment in his dearest hopes, he had not experienced any that arose from the meaness and self love of men: his station was too high to allow of his suffering through their hardheartedness; and too low for him to have experienced ingratitude and encroaching selfishness: it is one of the blessings of a moderate fortune, that by preventing the possessor from confering pecuniary favours it prevents him also from diving into the arcana of human weakness or malice To bestow on your fellow men is a Godlike attribute So indeed it is and as such not one fit for mortality; the giver like Adam and Prometheus, must pay the penalty of rising above his nature by being the martyr to his own excellence."
1,"I strove to think that all this grandeur was but more glaring infamy, and that, by planting his gold enwoven flag beside my tarnished and tattered banner, he proclaimed not his superiority, but his debasement."
1,"Much of this tale she concealed from Raymond; nor did she confess, that repulse and denial, as to a criminal convicted of the worst of crimes, that of bringing the scythe of foreign despotism to cut away the new springing liberties of her country, would have followed her application to any among the Greeks."
1,During three months I have been employed in this task.
1,"I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions."
1,Why did dark night adorn herself with stars man saw them not?
1,"Oh, beloved father Accept the pure heart of your unhappy daughter; permit me to join you unspotted as I was or you will not recognize my altered semblance."
1,"I lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage, my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon nearly touched."
1,"I accompanied the whale fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage."
1,"Why should he lose this, now that added years, prudence, and the pledge which his marriage gave to his country, ought to encrease, rather than diminish his claims to confidence?"
1,"Others made long journies to unite themselves to those they loved, and arrived to find them dead."
1,"It is our distance from them and our imperfect means of communication that makes them appear to move; in truth they always remain stationary, a glorious centre, giving us a fine lesson of modesty if we would thus receive it."""
1,"Idris was too much taken up by her own dreadful fears, to be angry, hardly grieved; for she judged that insensibility must be the source of this continued rancour."
1,During her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her.
1,"A little patience, and all will be over; aye, a very little patience; for, look, there is the key of our prison; we hold it in our own hands, and are we more debased than slaves to cast it away and give ourselves up to voluntary bondage?"
1,"Her father was moved by her violent grief; he took her in his arms and soothed her, but his very soothings were solemn and fearful."
1,"But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear."
1,"We feared the balmy air we feared the cloudless sky, the flower covered earth, and delightful woods, for we looked on the fabric of the universe no longer as our dwelling, but our tomb, and the fragrant land smelled to the apprehension of fear like a wide church yard."
1,"It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which I am preparing to depart."
1,"I could not sustain the horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim, I rushed out of the court in agony."
1,"I am not like one of these; they influenced millions: but if I can influence but a hundred, but ten, but one solitary individual, so as in any way to lead him from ill to good, that will be a joy to repay me for all my sufferings, though they were a million times multiplied; and that hope will support me to bear them."
1,"With considerable difficulty we scrambled up, and came to another passage with still more of illumination, and this led to another ascent like the former."
1,"""That evidence,"" he observed, ""was hardly required in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so decisive."""
1,"The children were easily distracted, and again returned to their prospect of future amusement."
1,"But that my firm courage and cheerful exertions might shelter the dear mate, whom I chose in the spring of my life; though the throbbings of my heart be replete with pain, though my hopes for the future are chill, still while your dear head, my gentlest love, can repose in peace on that heart, and while you derive from its fostering care, comfort, and hope, my struggles shall not cease, I will not call myself altogether vanquished."

1,"My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief."
1,"I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative happiness, and I think of them with pleasure."
1,"The soil was barren, scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare."
1,"She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage."
1,"The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove."
1,"The immediate peril urged them to seize the immediate opportunity; wildly and passionately they sought to know what delights existence afforded, before they yielded to death, and Snatching their pleasures with rough strife Thorough the iron gates of life, they defied the conquering pestilence to destroy what had been, or to erase even from their death bed thoughts the sentiment of happiness which had been theirs."
1,"On a dreary heath bestrewen with stones, among which short grass grew; and here and there a few rushes beside a little pool."
1,"The death of many of our inmates had weaned us from the fond idea, that Windsor Castle was a spot sacred from the plague; but our lease of life was renewed for some months, and even Idris lifted her head, as a lily after a storm, when a last sunbeam tinges its silver cup."

1,"In fact, now that the idea of contest was dismissed, all hearts returned to their former respect and admiration of our accomplished friend."
1,"If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed."
1,"When I was about five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como."
1,"I entered, and one glance assured me that its former inhabitant was no more he lay on a heap of straw, cold and stiff; while a pernicious effluvia filled the room, and various stains and marks served to shew the virulence of the disorder."
1,What I have become since this last moment I know not; perhaps I am changed in mien as the fallen archangel.
1,"The object of her life was to do him pleasure: it had been so before, but with a difference."
1,"When we arrived, after a little rest, he led me over the house and pointed out to me the rooms which my mother had inhabited."
1,"""What a noble fellow"" you will exclaim."
1,"The sharp frost and heavy snows tamed the animals, and kept the country gentlemen by their firesides; we got more game than we could eat, and my faithful dog grew sleek upon our refuse."
1,"To suspect evil, to perceive that, Alfred being with us, the danger must regard her youngest darling, to fly across the long chambers into his apartment, was the work but of a moment."
1,We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition.
1,"These bleak skies I hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings."
1,"This burst of passionate feeling over, with calmed thoughts we sat together, talking of the past and present."
1,"My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during sleep alone that I could taste joy."
1,"He is wronged, betrayed, imprisoned save him Verney, you must do this; seek him out in whatever part of the island he is immured; find him, rescue him from his persecutors, restore him to himself, to me on the wide earth I have none to love but only him"" Her earnest appeal, so sweetly and passionately expressed, filled me with wonder and sympathy; and, when she added, with thrilling voice and look, ""Do you consent to undertake this enterprize?"""
1,Our prime festivals were held in Perdita's cottage; nor were we ever weary of talking of the past or dreaming of the future.
1,"M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences."

1,"Sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor."
1,"Evadne's constancy, fortitude, even her ill fated and ill regulated love, were matter of admiration and pity; especially when, from the detail of the events of the nineteenth of October, it was apparent that she preferred suffering and death to any in her eyes degrading application for the pity and assistance of her lover."
1,"My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit."
1,"The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour: The sounding cataract Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to him An appetite; a feeling, and a love, That had no need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, or any interest Unborrow'd from the eye."
1,"""She will of course, as I shall her, when we are married."""
1,"One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death."
1,"His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French, ""I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable?"""
1,"With shuddering horror I veiled this monument of human passion and human misery; I heaped over her all of flags and heavy accoutrements I could find, to guard her from birds and beasts of prey, until I could bestow on her a fitting grave."
1,"""My dear girl,"" he said, ""I have been to blame; but you must pardon me."
1,"And poor Clerval "" The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears."
1,"Each word was drawn out with difficulty; real anguish painted his features; his eyes were now lifted in sudden horror, now fixed in dread upon the ground."
1,But in the city things wore a different face.
1,"The Rubicon, I felt, was passed; and it behoved me well to reflect what I should do on this hither side of disease and danger."
1,"But neither this assurance, nor the speedy convalescence of our child could restore her, even to the portion of peace she before enjoyed."
1,"That consideration made me breathless with anguish, and impressing itself on my imagination I was unable for a time to follow up any train of ideas."
1,"Your heart I fear, replied Diotima, was broken by your sufferings but if you had struggled if when you found all hope of earthly happiness wither within you while desire of it scorched your soul if you had near you a friend to have raised you to the contemplation of beauty the search of knowledge you would have found perhaps not new hopes spring within you but a new life distinct from that of passion by which you had before existed relate to me what this misery was that thus engroses you tell me what were the vicissitudes of feeling that you endured on earth after death our actions worldly interest fade as nothing before us but the traces of our feelings exist the memories of those are what furnish us here with eternal subject of meditation."
1,"""Not so,"" said I, ""though I confess that my thoughts are not occupied as pleasantly as yours are."
1,"And yet I fear it; even as I fear all things; for in any state of being linked by the chain of memory with this, happiness would not return even in Paradise, I must feel that your love was less enduring than the mortal beatings of my fragile heart, every pulse of which knells audibly, The funeral note Of love, deep buried, without resurrection."
1,For a long time I was their only care.
1,"Night closed in, and it began to rain."
1,The offspring of the deepest love I displayed from my earliest years the greatest sensibility of disposition.
1,"Felix rejected his offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard."
1,"As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them."

1,Cheers and loud acclamations followed the close of his speech.
1,I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself.
1,Her expressive eyes were two stars whose beams were love; hope and light heartedness sat on her cloudless brow.
1,"The benches were very empty, those by custom occupied by the hereditary members were vacant; the city members were there the members for the commercial towns, few landed proprietors, and not many of those who entered parliament for the sake of a career."
1,"I had scarcely uttered these words than a flash instantly followed by a tremendous peal of thunder descended on it; and when my eyes recovered their sight after the dazzling light, the oak no longer stood in the meadow The old man uttered a wild exclamation of horror when he saw so sudden an interpretation given to my prophesy."
1,I stay here; force only can remove me.
1,"He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art, yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence."
1,"If it indeed be that; if the efforts of the virtuous now, are to make the future inhabitants of this fair world more happy; if the labours of those who cast aside selfishness, and try to know the truth of things, are to free the men of ages, now far distant but which will one day come, from the burthen under which those who now live groan, and like you weep bitterly; if they free them but from one of what are now the necessary evils of life, truly I will not fail but will with my whole soul aid the work."
1,"New feelings had arisen within her, which she was unable to express in writing to one whom she had only known in childhood; but we saw each other again, and our intimacy was renewed as if nothing had intervened to check it."
1,"By the reigning God it is true; the paltry earldom of Windsor shall no longer content him, who will inherit the rights which must for ever appertain to the person who possesses it."
1,Could he allude to an object on whom I dared not even think?
1,"He called for the people of the house, but could learn nothing from them, except that they knew nothing."
1,This spot had for me peculiar charms.
1,The plague had come to Athens.
1,"The inhabitants of Berkshire and Bucks had been long aware that the plague was in London, in Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, York, in short, in all the more populous towns of England."
1,We have forgotten what we did when she was not.
1,"I will see you to morrow; in the meantime, adieu"" She rose, and walked from the room; but pausing at the door, and leaning against it, as if her over busy thoughts had taken from her the power of supporting herself, she said, ""Lord Raymond will probably return."
1,I renounced it to gain no matter what for that also I have lost.
1,"His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction."
1,"The days that followed were full of pain to me; so that I sometimes regretted that I had not yielded at once to the haughty lady, who watched all my motions, and turned my beloved task of nursing my friend to a work of pain and irritation."
1,"They consisted of people of the middling and lower classes of society, whose means of subsistence failed with the cessation of trade, and of the busy spirit of money making in all its branches, peculiar to our country."
1,"As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me."
1,"Your gentle nature would not permit you to hate your greatest enemy and though I be he, although I have rent happiness from your grasp; though I have passed over your young love and hopes as the angel of destruction, finding beauty and joy, and leaving blight and despair, yet you will forgive me, and with eyes overflowing with tears I thank you; my beloved one, I accept your pardon with a gratitude that will never die, and that will, indeed it will, outlive guilt and remorse."
1,Every one loved him; no shadow of envy or hate cast even from the meanest mind ever fell upon him.
1,"There were periods, dreadful ones, during which I despaired doubted the existence of all duty the reality of crime but I shudder, and turn from the rememberance."
1,I cannot describe the tumult of emotions that arose within me as I read it.
1,"This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me forever."
1,"""Where are we?"" she cried, ""where are we going?"""
1,But soon I endeavoured to extract patience for her from the ideas she suggested.
1,"Adrian and Idris saw this; they attributed it to my long watching and anxiety; they urged me to rest, and take care of myself, while I most truly assured them, that my best medicine was their good wishes; those, and the assured convalescence of my friend, now daily more apparent."
1,"""My friends,"" I said, ""our risk is common; our precautions and exertions shall be common also."
1,"But winter was coming, and with winter, hope."
1,"Wretched beings crawled to die under our succouring roof; the inhabitants of the Castle decreased daily, while the survivors huddled together in fear, and, as in a famine struck boat, the sport of the wild, interminable waves, each looked in the other's face, to guess on whom the death lot would next fall."
1,"I committed the remains of my lost Perdita to his care, for the purpose of having them transported to Hymettus, and placed in the cell her Raymond already occupied beneath the pyramid."
1,"His abdication of the Protectorate had caused an unexampled sensation; and, when his magnificent and manly system was contrasted with the narrow views of succeeding politicians, the period of his elevation was referred to with sorrow."
1,I never beheld anything so utterly destroyed.
1,"He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can you wonder that these men were moved?"
1,"Many changes also now occurred in these spontaneous regal elections: depositions and abdications were frequent, while, in the place of the old and prudent, the ardent youth would step forward, eager for action, regardless of danger."
1,"I was perplexed, and most anxious to know what this portended; ah, what could it portend but ruin I saw little of my father during this interval, but he appeared calmer although not less unhappy than before."
1,"The rain ceased; the clouds sunk behind the horizon; it was now evening, and the sun descended swiftly the western sky."
1,"I continued: ""This poor wretch is deserted, dying, succourless; in these unhappy times, God knows how soon any or all of us may be in like want."
1,"Reasoning and persuasion were thrown away upon her; she would endure no hindrance, no delay."
1,"We landed, and proceeded to Paris."
1,"The king, who was a man of excellent dispositions, but easily led, had now become a willing disciple of his imperious consort."
1,"""'Heaven forbid Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue."
1,"He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they inhabited."
1,"There is something fearful in one who can thus conquer the animal part of our nature, if the victory be not the effect of consummate virtue; nor was it without a mixture of this feeling, that I beheld the figure of the Countess awake when others slept, fasting when I, abstemious naturally, and rendered so by the fever that preyed on me, was forced to recruit myself with food."
1,"Surely the glorious twins of Latona were not more welcome, when, in the infancy of the world, they were brought forth to beautify and enlighten this ""sterile promontory,"" than were this angelic pair to my lowly dwelling and grateful heart."
1,"Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded."
1,She had not confided in me; I could not demand an explanation from Raymond without the hazard of betraying what was perhaps her most treasured secret.
1,"I dismissed the guests therefore; and they went thoughtful, more than sad, to await the events in store for them."
1,Often with maternal affection she had figured their merits and talents exerted on life's wide stage.
1,"Day, hateful to me, dawned; I retreated to my lodgings I threw myself on a couch I slept was it sleep?"
1,"It was a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence."
1,Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness?
1,"I signified my readiness to proceed, but our guides protested against such a measure."
1,"The poor perceived that the rich possessed other means of preservation than those which could be partaken of by themselves, seclusion, and, as far as circumstances permitted, freedom from care."
1,"At a distance from facts one draws conclusions which appear infallible, which yet when put to the test of reality, vanish like unreal dreams."
1,"But I was languid and many hours passed before I could reach the cottage, dragging as I did my slow steps, and often resting on the wet earth unable to proceed."
1,I profited of this time to rest for a few hours.
1,"When I awoke it rained: I was already quite wet, and my limbs were stiff and my head giddy with the chill of night."
1,"But a few months have elapsed since I believed that I was all the world to you; and that there was no happiness or grief for you on earth unshared by your Mathilda your child: that happy time is no longer, and what I most dreaded in this world is come upon me."
1,"In other places human beings were seldom seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path."
1,"We met other families on the Long Walk, enjoying like ourselves the return of the genial season."
1,"We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history."
1,"It was a melancholy pleasure to me to listen to his inspired words; to catch for a moment the light of his eyes; to feel a transient sympathy and then to awaken from the delusion, again to know that all this was nothing, a dream a shadow for that there was no reallity for me; my father had for ever deserted me, leaving me only memories which set an eternal barrier between me and my fellow creatures."
1,"I carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity."
1,"Fifteen months after their marriage I was born, and my mother died a few days after my birth."
1,"Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise."""
1,This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years.
1,"So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted."
1,Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?
1,"A remembrance of the discourses of my parents, and the communications which my mother endeavoured to impress upon me concerning my father's friends, in slight hope that I might one day derive benefit from the knowledge, floated like an indistinct dream through my brain."
1,I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.
1,"""I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors for so I loved, in an innocent, half painful self deceit, to call them."""
1,"Sleeping thus under the beneficent eye of heaven, can evil visit thee, O Earth, or grief cradle to their graves thy luckless children?"
1,"""Do not catechise me, Lionel; I will do my duty by her, be assured."
1,"I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife, and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy."
1,"At first it was the great object of my ambition to rival the merits of my father, and render myself worthy of the friendship of Adrian."
1,We quitted Athens on the nd of June.
1,"Is not this a free country?"" ""Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks."
1,"If I no longer saw the fresh glow of youth on his matured countenance, if care had besieged his brow, ""And dug deep trenches in his beauty's field,"" if his hair, slightly mingled with grey, and his look, considerate even in its eagerness, gave signs of added years and past sufferings, yet there was something irresistibly affecting in the sight of one, lately snatched from the grave, renewing his career, untamed by sickness or disaster."
1,"Evadne's feminine prudence perceived how useless any assertion of his resolves would be, till added years gave weight to his power."
1,"Be it light with him when it is darkness with me Let him feel the sun of summer while I am chilled by the snows of winter Let there be the distance of the antipodes between us At length the east began to brighten, and the comfortable light of morning streamed into my room."
1,She framed her enquiries with Greek subtlety; she formed her conclusions with the decision and firmness peculiar to her disposition.
1,"He accused me of melancholy, of ill humour and envy."
1,"Study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellow creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children."
1,The first sight of this place for a time unhinged her.
1,"Good God In what desert land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient?"
1,"The revenue of its possessor, which had always found a mode of expenditure congenial to his generous nature, was now attended to more parsimoniously, that it might embrace a wider portion of utility."
1,Alas Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life?
1,"They fly quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach."
1,"His voice expressed the deepest compassion: ""Thou most unaccountable being,"" I cried, ""whither will thy actions tend, in all this maze of purpose in which thou seemest lost?"" ""Whither indeed?"
1,"To change the scene for her, and even for ourselves, all unhinged by the cloud that had come over us, I persuaded my two remaining companions that it were better that we should absent ourselves for a time from Windsor."
1,A mirror betrayed the sign to Idris she started up.
1,The poor little thing's fever encreased towards night.
1,"It was not as in summer time, when each hour might bring the dreaded fate until summer, we felt sure; and this certainty, short lived as it must be, yet for awhile satisfied her maternal tenderness."
1,"I find myself, for one, as a stringed instrument with chords and stops but I have no power to turn the pegs, or pitch my thoughts to a higher or lower key."""
1,Her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends.
1,"Pestilence had become a part of our future, our existence; it was to be guarded against, like the flooding of rivers, the encroachments of ocean, or the inclemency of the sky."
1,"The crime had its source in her; be hers the punishment Thanks to the lessons of Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work mischief."
1,"She was delighted to see us; caressed our children, praised their growth and improvement; Clara also was pleased to meet again her young friend Alfred; all kinds of childish games were entered into, in which Perdita joined."
1,Discipline was lost; the army disbanded itself.
1,What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp.
1,This speech troubled me.
1,"Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow."
1,"Suffering and amiability may exist together, and writers have loved to depict their conjunction; there is a human and touching harmony in the picture."
1,In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.
1,"The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the charge, several witnesses were called."
1,"Yes, you are the sole, the agonizing cause of all I suffer, of all I must suffer untill I die."
1,"I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed."
1,"Oh, no The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death."
1,"This promise of a renewed lease of life turned rugged natures to melting tenderness, and by contrast filled the soft with harsh and unnatural sentiments."
1,His plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.
1,"As it was an epidemic, its chief force was derived from pernicious qualities in the air, and it would probably do little harm where this was naturally salubrious."
1,I gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had given to his fellow professor.
1,"Now I must fulfil my vow; now range myself at his side, and be his ally and support till death."
1,"A feeling of devotion, of duty, of a high and steady purpose, elevated me; a strange joy filled my heart."
1,"More than a third of the members ranged themselves under Raymond, and their number was perpetually encreasing."
1,"It was a subject of regret to me whenever we were joined by a third person, yet if I turned with a disturbed look towards my father, his eyes fixed on me and beaming with tenderness instantly restored joy to my heart."
1,"Felix was too delicate to accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness."
1,Once it was so; now is man lord of the creation?
1,"All I can say is, that it is so."
1,"But now, in the midst of the dying and the dead, how could a thought of heaven or a sensation of tranquillity possess one of the murderers?"
1,"Be it your care to foster this similarity be it your care to render her worthy of him, so that, when she glory in her origin, she take not shame for what she is."""
1,"""Here they are,"" he cried, ""beautiful creatures breathing, speaking, loving creatures."
1,"On our arrival in London, we found that the aged Countess of Windsor was residing with her son in the palace of the Protectorate; we repaired to our accustomed abode near Hyde Park."
1,"The excitement which had hitherto sustained me was lost; as a building, whose props are loosened, and whose foundations rock, totters and falls, so when enthusiasm and hope deserted me, did my strength fail."
1,"At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence."
1,"It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries."
1,"The path to it had been enlarged, and steps hewn in the rock led us less circuitously than before, to the spot itself; the platform on which the pyramid stood was enlarged, and looking towards the south, in a recess overshadowed by the straggling branches of a wild fig tree, I saw foundations dug, and props and rafters fixed, evidently the commencement of a cottage; standing on its unfinished threshold, the tomb was at our right hand, the whole ravine, and plain, and azure sea immediately before us; the dark rocks received a glow from the descending sun, which glanced along the cultivated valley, and dyed in purple and orange the placid waves; we sat on a rocky elevation, and I gazed with rapture on the beauteous panorama of living and changeful colours, which varied and enhanced the graces of earth and ocean."
1,"Often too, the voice to which all listened was suddenly silenced, the helping hand cold, the sympathetic eye closed, and the villagers feared still more the death that had selected a choice victim, shivering in dust the heart that had beat for them, reducing to incommunicable annihilation the mind for ever occupied with projects for their welfare."
1,At eleven years of age Diana was his favourite playmate but he already talked the language of love.
1,His person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.
1,"Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour."
1,"I hastily gave my consent to this arrangement, and as hastily formed a plan through which Perdita should be forced to become my companion."
1,"They know our infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives."
1,"Here were the future governors of England; the men, who, when our ardour was cold, and our projects completed or destroyed for ever, when, our drama acted, we doffed the garb of the hour, and assumed the uniform of age, or of more equalizing death; here were the beings who were to carry on the vast machine of society; here were the lovers, husbands, fathers; here the landlord, the politician, the soldier; some fancied that they were even now ready to appear on the stage, eager to make one among the dramatis personae of active life."
1,"""But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I reached the environs of Geneva."
1,"In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well being."
1,"As manhood dawned upon him, his schemes and theories, far from being changed by personal and prudential motives, acquired new strength from the powers he felt arise within him; and his love for Evadne became deep rooted, as he each day became more certain that the path he pursued was full of difficulty, and that he must seek his reward, not in the applause or gratitude of his fellow creatures, hardly in the success of his plans, but in the approbation of his own heart, and in her love and sympathy, which was to lighten every toil and recompence every sacrifice."

1,"Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared."

1,"Yet such is human nature, that the excitement of mind was dear to me, and that the imagination, painter of tempest and earthquake, or, worse, the stormy and ruin fraught passions of man, softened my real sorrows and endless regrets, by clothing these fictitious ones in that ideality, which takes the mortal sting from pain."

1,"While every mind was full of dismay at its effects, a craving for excitement had led us to peruse De Foe's account, and the masterly delineations of the author of Arthur Mervyn."
1,"I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenly if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore often, I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters might close over me and my calamities forever."
1,"He remembered the words of her letter and he indulged the wild idea that his kisses breathing warm love and life would infuse new spirit into her, and that with him near her she could not die; that his presence was the talisman of her life."
1,"Promise,"" and he raised himself painfully, and seized my arm, ""promise to bury me with them."""
1,"He tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels."
1,"He shall find that I can feel my injuries; he shall learn to dread my revenge"" A few days after he arrived."

1,"This intelligence brought us back from the prospect of paradise, held out after the lapse of an hundred thousand years, to the pain and misery at present existent upon earth."

1,"But I consented to listen, and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale."
1,"I can do this I can marry Idris."""
1,"At length we reached the overhanging beach; a cottage stood beside the path; we knocked at the door and it was opened: the bed within instantly caught my eye; something stiff and straight lay on it, covered by a sheet; the cottagers looked aghast."
1,"It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me, ""I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself."
1,"I receded to solitude; I had recourse to my books, and my desire again to enjoy the society of Adrian became a burning thirst."
1,"I passed through the gap of the broken paling I felt, while I disdained, the choaking tears I rushed into the depths of the forest."

1,"After the revolution of ages Birnam hill was again covered with a young forest, while more aged pines, planted at the very commencement of the nineteenth century by the then Duke of Athol, gave solemnity and beauty to the scene."

1,"""This is better, Mamma,"" said Clara, ""than being in that dismal London, where you often cry, and never laugh as you do now."""
1,"A gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance."
1,I drank of an enchanted cup but gall was at the bottom of its long drawn sweetness.
1,"But such miseries could never intrude upon the domestic circle left to me, while, secluded in our beloved forest, we passed our lives in tranquillity."
1,"Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes."
1,"Yet untill I find him I must force reason to keep her seat, and I pressed my forehead hard with my hands Oh do not leave me; or I shall forget what I am about instead of driving on as we ought with the speed of lightning they will attend to me, and we shall be too late."

1,"""Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country, which differed from that of my protectors."
1,But it is your happiness I desire as well as my own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.
1,"These events have affected me, God knows how deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are."
1,"But when any whole nation becomes the victim of the destructive powers of exterior agents, then indeed man shrinks into insignificance, he feels his tenure of life insecure, his inheritance on earth cut off."

1,"But my essay towards bringing her to a saner view of her own situation, did not end here."
1,Raymond had joined in the former part of the discussion.

1,"Some, in the true spirit of reckless enterprise, went on board a ship of an hundred and twenty guns; the vast hull drifted with the tide out of the bay, and after many hours its crew of landsmen contrived to spread a great part of her enormous canvass the wind took it, and while a thousand mistakes of the helmsman made her present her head now to one point, and now to another, the vast fields of canvass that formed her sails flapped with a sound like that of a huge cataract; or such as a sea like forest may give forth when buffeted by an equinoctial north wind."

1,"The knowledge of his success had become so much a part of himself, that he forgot that it was necessary to impart it to his companion."

1,"The Countess again came to her daughter's bedside: ""In Austria at least,"" she said, ""you will obey."
1,"Cursed, cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms."
1,"They shall behold the antipodes of what is real for I will appear to live while I am dead."""
1,"""You will never hear from me again: receive these then as the last words of mine that will ever reach you; and although I have forfeited your filial love, yet regard them I conjure you as a father's command."
1,"I was already well acquainted with what I may term the panorama of nature, the change of seasons, and the various appearances of heaven and earth."
1,Whither does this lead?
1,"""Dearest niece,"" said my father, ""dry your tears."
1,"In the face of all this we call ourselves lords of the creation, wielders of the elements, masters of life and death, and we allege in excuse of this arrogance, that though the individual is destroyed, man continues for ever."
1,"She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness, but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister."

1,The apparition was soon explained.
1,"Ah, dear sister, how can I answer this question?"
1,"She had gone to hide her weakness; escaping from the castle, she had descended to the little park, and sought solitude, that she might there indulge her tears; I found her clinging round an old oak, pressing its rough trunk with her roseate lips, as her tears fell plenteously, and her sobs and broken exclamations could not be suppressed; with surpassing grief I beheld this loved one of my heart thus lost in sorrow I drew her towards me; and, as she felt my kisses on her eyelids, as she felt my arms press her, she revived to the knowledge of what remained to her. ""You are very kind not to reproach me,"" she said: ""I weep, and a bitter pang of intolerable sorrow tears my heart."

1,"Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn, but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for Germany."

1,"Something more was in his heart, to which he dared not give words."
1,"Yet we advanced slowly: sometimes I thought that we should never arrive; that the sound of waves would still allure us, and that we should walk on for ever and ever: field succeeding field, never would our weary journey cease, nor night nor day; but still we should hear the dashing of the sea, and to all this there would be no end."
1,"""All things go on,"" thought Perdita, ""all things proceed, decay, and perish When noontide has passed, and the weary day has driven her team to their western stalls, the fires of heaven rise from the East, moving in their accustomed path, they ascend and descend the skiey hill."

1,"He was, as it were, now awakened from his long, visionary sleep, and he felt some what like one of the seven sleepers, or like Nourjahad, in that sweet imitation of an eastern tale: Diana was gone; his friends were changed or dead, and now on his awakening I was all that he had to love on earth."
1,I will proceed with my tale.
1,"As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large."
1,"On you it rests, whether I quit forever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin."""

1,"He often thanked us for the books we lent him, and for the use of our instruments, but never spoke of his altered abode or change of circumstances."
1,My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.
1,The one he had acquired in Greece; the other he had sacrificed to love.
1,"""Certainly,"" replied the ex queen, with bitter scorn, ""his love, and her love, and both their childish flutterings, are to be put in fit comparison with my years of hope and anxiety, with the duties of the offspring of kings, with the high and dignified conduct which one of her descent ought to pursue."
1,Clerval spent the last evening with us.
1,"Sights of woe now became familiar to me, and were I to tell all of anguish and pain that I witnessed, of the despairing moans of age, and the more terrible smiles of infancy in the bosom of horror, my reader, his limbs quivering and his hair on end, would wonder how I did not, seized with sudden frenzy, dash myself from some precipice, and so close my eyes for ever on the sad end of the world."
1,"I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood."
1,This account may be taken as a sample of my intercourse with Lord Raymond.
1,A vain concession; his demeanour quickly betrayed his secret to the quick eyes of the ex queen.
1,"""You propose,"" replied I, ""to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions."
1,"Does the reader wish to hear of the pest houses, where death is the comforter of the mournful passage of the death cart of the insensibility of the worthless, and the anguish of the loving heart of harrowing shrieks and silence dire of the variety of disease, desertion, famine, despair, and death?"

1,"We conjectured, notwithstanding what we had heard, that we should find Raymond in St. Stephen's: thither we sped."
1,"She fell, however, into good hands."
1,"In a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees."

1,"He was, as one the peculiar delight of the Gods, railed and fenced in by his own divinity, so that nought but love and admiration could approach him."

1,"So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation."
1,There was but one good and one evil in the world life and death.
1,"""Pardon me,"" he replied, ""if I have offended."
1,"But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an hour's rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly irksome to me, I continued my route."
1,"""My dear Victor, do not speak thus."
1,"Day after day so many hundreds wore on; they brought no outward changes with them, but some few slowly operated on my mind as I glided on towards death."
1,"When Raymond offered to clear her reputation, and demonstrate to the world her real patriotism, she declared that it was only through her present sufferings that she hoped for any relief to the stings of conscience; that, in her state of mind, diseased as he might think it, the necessity of occupation was salutary medicine; she ended by extorting a promise that for the space of one month he would refrain from the discussion of her interests, engaging after that time to yield in part to his wishes."

1,"But I perceive, too soon for my own happiness, too late for England's good, that I undertook a task to which I am unequal."
1,"Do not endeavour to deprive me of my companion, the out cast's friend."
1,"""It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him that I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son's sorrow."

1,We arrived at Kishan on the th of July.
1,"Stress of weather drove us up the Adriatic Gulph; and, our vessel being hardly fitted to weather a storm, we took refuge in the port of Ancona."
1,"The intense life that quickened my pulses, and animated my frame, had the effect, not of drawing me into the mazes of active life, but of exalting my lowliness, and of bestowing majestic proportions on insignificant objects I could have lived the life of a peasant in the same way my trifling occupations were swelled into important pursuits; my affections were impetuous and engrossing passions, and nature with all her changes was invested in divine attributes."
1,The kind of banishment he now experienced arose from other causes.
1,"I was, I own, often tempted to recur to the lawless feats of my boy hood, and knock down the almost tame pheasants that perched upon the trees, and bent their bright eyes on me."

1,"Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household."
1,"Each day the soldiers of the garrison assaulted our advanced posts, and impeded the accomplishment of our works."
1,"I was indignant that he should sit at the same table with the companions of Raymond men of abandoned characters, or rather without any, the refuse of high bred luxury, the disgrace of their country."
1,"But I am about to die nay, interrupt me not soon I shall die."
1,"All went on cheerfully now; we met as usual, and talked without dread of our future plans."
1,The eye easily discerns the sister land; they were united once; and the little path that runs between looks in a map but as a trodden footway through high grass.
1,"Trade was stopped by the failure of the interchange of cargoes usual between us, and America, India, Egypt and Greece."
1,"Are you a coward, Woodville?"
1,"The nature of riches and influence forcibly confined the list of candidates to a few of the wealthiest; and it was much to be feared, that the ill humour and contention generated by this triennial struggle, would counterbalance its advantages in impartial eyes."
1,"He began to answer with violence: ""Yes, yes, I hate you You are my bane, my poison, my disgust Oh No"" And then his manner changed, and fixing his eyes on me with an expression that convulsed every nerve and member of my frame ""you are none of all these; you are my light, my only one, my life."
1,We could not fear we did not.
1,"But the intermediate steps, the climbing the wall, raised up between what was and is, while I still looked back nor saw the concealed desert beyond, is a labour past my strength."
1,"It was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood."
1,"Nay, more, that this aspiring noble revived the claim of the house of Windsor to the crown, and that, on the event of Adrian's incurable disorder and his marriage with the sister, the brow of the ambitious Raymond might be encircled with the magic ring of regality."
1,"Adrian suddenly vanished; and, by the time that Raymond's supporters were reduced to our intimate friends merely, returned leading Idris to congratulate her friend on his success."
1,I shall not be suspected of being averse to the Greek cause; I know and feel its necessity; it is beyond every other a good cause.
1,"The student left his books, the artist his study: the occupations of life were gone, but the amusements remained; enjoyment might be protracted to the verge of the grave."
1,The native modesty of his disposition conquered the joy of his triumph.
1,"His extraction was obscure; but circumstances brought him early into public notice, and his small paternal property was soon dissipated in the splendid scene of fashion and luxury in which he was an actor."
1,"Farewell, Raymond; be happy in having chosen the better part in life."
1,This lovely child was nearly eight years of age.
1,"To you alone do I dare speak; I have heard you commended by impartial spectators; you are my brother's friends, therefore you must be mine."
1,"But he was impatient of the years that must intervene, he was frank of heart and fearless."
1,"What was I? The question again recurred, to be answered only with groans."
1,She was lovely; her manners were frank and simple; her deep blue eyes swam in a lustre which could only be given by sensibility joined to wisdom.
1,"The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality."
1,"Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much dreaded to behold."
1,"The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe."
1,"Shakspeare, whose popularity was established by the approval of four centuries, had not lost his influence even at this dread period; but was still ""Ut magus,"" the wizard to rule our hearts and govern our imaginations."
1,"I would betake me with them to some wild beast's den, where a tyger's cubs, which I would slay, had been reared in health."
1,"I was a poor, uneducated, unbefriended, mountain girl, raised from nothingness by him."
1,IN the mean time what did Perdita?
1,"I ordered her to bring my breakfast to my room, and was again left alone yet still I could make no resolve, but only thought that I might write a note to my father to beg his permission to pay a visit to a relation who lived about thirty miles off, and who had before invited me to her house, but I had refused for then I could not quit my suffering father."
1,"Yes, I am happy, most happy, that I can weep thus for imaginary sorrows, and that the slight loss of my adored country is not dwindled and annihilated in mightier misery."
1,"The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled."
1,"When he heard the sound of my approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window."
1,"The sea was fifty miles off, yet it was towards it that he fled."
1,"A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath, and bushes, which I had collected."
1,With summer and mortality grew our fears.
1,"Truly it was a fairy's supper; for though the air was perfumed by the scent of fruits and wine, we none of us either ate or drank even the beauty of the night was unobserved; their extasy could not be increased by outward objects, and I was wrapt in reverie."
1,"I perceived, as the shape came nearer sight tremendous and abhorred that it was the wretch whom I had created."
1,"I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours."
1,"In the north it was worse the lesser population gradually declined, and famine and plague kept watch on the survivors, who, helpless and feeble, were ready to fall an easy prey into their hands."
1,"Well it was here we sat together, and when you hear all that past all that of terrible tore our souls even in this placid spot, which but for strange passions might have been a paradise to us, you will not wonder that I remember it as I looked on it that its calm might give me calm, and inspire me not only with courage but with persuasive words."
1,"M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits."
1,This also was refused.
1,"Perdita shook her head; ""If it could be so,"" she replied, ""I were much in the wrong to disdain your offers."
1,"Thousands died unlamented; for beside the yet warm corpse the mourner was stretched, made mute by death."
1,"""My dear Victor,"" cried he, ""what, for God's sake, is the matter?"
1,I revolved a thousand and a thousand plans.
1,"He was alone, examining some petitions lately presented."
1,"I ran on at my utmost speed until I found myself I knew not how, close to Westminster Abbey, and was attracted by the deep and swelling tone of the organ."
1,"He submitted to be away from her, because she commanded this submission; but for her influence, he would have declared his attachment before all England, and resisted, with unshaken constancy, his mother's opposition."
1,"Over the deep grave of my secret I must heap an impenetrable heap of false smiles and words: cunning frauds, treacherous laughter and a mixture of all light deceits would form a mist to blind others and be as the poisonous simoon to me."
1,I asked her where he should be buried.
1,"I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was, to your destruction and infallible misery."
1,"For myself, I will not voluntarily seek death, that is, I will not, while I can command myself; and I can here."
1,"""Other men,"" I observed, ""may be better musicians."""
1,"Subscriptions were made for the emigrants, and merchants bankrupt by the failure of trade."
1,"It was from my own Elizabeth: ""My dearest Cousin, ""You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account."
1,"But these were few, in comparison to the numbers who actually crossed."
1,"What a sea is the tide of passion, whose fountains are in our own nature Our virtues are the quick sands, which shew themselves at calm and low water; but let the waves arise and the winds buffet them, and the poor devil whose hope was in their durability, finds them sink from under him."
1,"You will wonder then, as I do, at the extent of his accomplishments, and the brilliancy of his talents."""
1,We were surely sufficiently degraded.
1,Adrian welcomed us on our arrival.
1,"In the same spirit of exaggeration she had, on the event of her separation from Raymond, caused it to be entirely neglected."
1,My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.
1,A mightier power than the human was at hand to destroy our plans or to achieve the work we avoided.
1,"""Thou wilt ever be the same."
1,"This was a strange speech, now that, on the empty stage, each might play his part without impediment from the other."
1,"As for instance, a typhus fever has been brought by ships to one sea port town; yet the very people who brought it there, were incapable of communicating it in a town more fortunately situated."
1,"But, no, it is not so; I have my Mathilda, my consolation, and my hope."""
1,Perdita was sensible of the failing of the tide that fed her life.
1,A murmur of approbation rose after his speech.
1,"She thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her."
1,"When I appeared, she turned away, and in reply to my enquiries, only said, ""You know not what you have done"" I trusted that this sullenness betokened merely the struggle between disappointment and natural affection, and that in a few days she would be reconciled to her fate."
1,"I cannot lead on to battle; I cannot, through intrigue and faithlessness rear again the throne upon the wreck of English public spirit."
1,"By degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey towards Geneva."
1,"Oh There is a fearful chasm; but I adjure you to beware"" ""Ah, dearest friend"" I cried, ""do not fear Speak that word; it will bring peace, not death."
1,"I returned to Windsor by the Long Walk, and passing through the town towards the Castle, I found it in a state of agitation and disturbance."
1,"I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it."
1,"I would not remain on the sea coast, but proceeded immediately inland."
1,"In other studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder."
1,"""I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification."
1,"Alas, poor country; Almost afraid to know itself It cannot Be called our mother, but our grave: where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile; Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks that rent the air, Are made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems A modern extasy: the dead man's knell Is there scarce asked, for who; and good men's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps, Dying, or ere they sicken."
1,"A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife."
1,"I shunned the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me; solitude was my only consolation deep, dark, deathlike solitude."
1,"The cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins."
1,"I cannot set my heart to a particular tune, or run voluntary changes on my will."
1,"The remains of the half finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being."
1,"I no longer despair, but look on all around me with placid affection."
1,"The scenes that followed, convinced her that she had not yet fathomed the obscure gulph into which she had plunged."
1,"'Let me go,' he cried; 'monster Ugly wretch You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces."
1,"You will not follow me, for when I bannish myself would you nourish guilt by obtruding yourself upon me?"
1,"Ashy pale, Raymond and Perdita sat apart, looking on with sad smiles."
1,"Each village, however small, usually contains a leader, one among themselves whom they venerate, whose advice they seek in difficulty, and whose good opinion they chiefly value."
1,"I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden."
1,"When my father had arrived the storm had already begun, but he had refused to stop and leaving his horse there he walked on towards the sea."
1,"There is nothing more melancholy than a merry meeting thus turned to sorrow: the gala dresses the decorations, gay as they might otherwise be, receive a solemn and funereal appearance."
1,"In the mean time, we, the wise of the land, will return to our Castle, and, Cincinnatus like, take to our usual labours, until our friend shall require our presence and assistance here."""
1,"I could not do otherwise, even if I had wished; for if we are said to have two souls, he was my better soul, to which the other was a perpetual slave."
1,"I began with light hand and gentle allurement; first exciting her curiosity, and then satisfying it in such a way as might occasion her, at the same time that she half forgot her sorrows in occupation, to find in the hours that succeeded a reaction of benevolence and toleration."
1,"Look into the mind of man, where wisdom reigns enthroned; where imagination, the painter, sits, with his pencil dipt in hues lovelier than those of sunset, adorning familiar life with glowing tints."
1,"Clara, though only twelve years old, was rendered, through extreme sensibility, so prudent and careful, that I felt secure in entrusting the charge of him to her, and it was my task to prevent Idris from observing their absence."
1,"A restlessness, a fear of what was about to betide, a doubt as to Raymond's purposes, urged me to return without delay to his quarters."
1,"CHAPTER VI My chamber was in a retired part of the house, and looked upon the garden so that no sound of the other inhabitants could reach it; and here in perfect solitude I wept for several hours."
1,"""We cannot hope to live so long in our names as some have done in their persons; one face of Janus holds no proportion to the other."""
1,"I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months, calm and serene joy."
1,"""Perdita,"" I had said, ""some day you will discover that you have done wrong in again casting Raymond on the thorns of life."
1,"Many a casque, and bayonet, and sword, fallen from unnerved arms, reflected the departing ray; they lay scattered far and near."
1,"But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat."
1,"His careless extravagance, which made him squander immense sums of money to satisfy passing whims, which from their apparent energy he dignified with the name of passions, often displayed itself in unbounded generosity."
1,"They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence."
1,Clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to Ingolstadt.
1,No; I am not so selfish.
1,The gentle words of Agatha and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.
1,"Here aloft, the companions of the swift winged birds, we skim through the unresisting element, fleetly and fearlessly."
1,"For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing."
1,From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.
1,"Patience, gentleness, and untired affection, shall recall him, if it be true, as Raymond says, that he is mad; energy and courage shall rescue him, if he be unjustly imprisoned."
1,All the ex queen's friends were his friends; no week passed that he did not hold consultations with her at Windsor.
1,Deeper grief oppressed Perdita.
1,"The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks."
1,"The king lamented his absence; he loved to repeat his sayings, relate the adventures they had had together, and exalt his talents but here ended his reminiscence."
1,"He spoke with a broken voice, then bowed his head, and, hiding his face in his hands, wept."
1,"And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine mine to protect, love, and cherish."
1,"Had I right, for my own benefit, to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations?"
1,When rocked by the waves of the lake my spirits rose in triumph as a horseman feels with pride the motions of his high fed steed.
1,"They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence."""
1,It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces.
1,"Our silence endured for some miles, till the country with open fields, or shady woods and parks, presented pleasant objects to our view."
1,"He had bought it, he said, with danger, and paid for it with toil."
1,Has she not bestowed on him every gift in prodigality?
1,"his own trusting, devoted, affectionate Perdita, whose generous belief galled him doubly, when he remembered the parade of innocence with which it had been exacted."
1,"The former Protector tendered him the oaths, and presented him with the insignia of office, performing the ceremonies of installation."
1,I saw this smile fade for ever.
1,"Let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments me."""
1,"Her letter to Raymond gave no clue for discovery; it assured him, that she was in no danger of wanting the means of life; she promised in it to preserve herself, and some future day perhaps to present herself to him in a station not unworthy of her."
1,"For this was it a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking."
1,"She did him justice; she believed that he felt a tender affection for her; but give a paltry prize to him who in some life pending lottery has calculated on the possession of tens of thousands, and it will disappoint him more than a blank."
1,"She went on, feeling that, if she had paused for a moment, the checked waters of misery would have deluged her soul, that her wrecked hopes would raise their wailing voices, and that those who now echoed her mirth, and provoked her repartees, would have shrunk in fear from her convulsive despair."
1,"But then my plan must be laid with art; I would not be left destitute, I must secure some money."
1,"The soul of tender sorrow is breathed forth in this strain; and the sweet voice of Idris, sustained by the mournful chords of her instrument, added to the expression of the words."
1,"In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude."
1,"But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment."
1,"He asserted, that each individual under the English monarchy, was then as now, capable of attaining high rank and power with one only exception, that of the function of chief magistrate; higher and nobler rank, than a bartering, timorous commonwealth could afford."
1,Late in the evening she entered the apartments appropriated to the festival.
1,"Idris hardly recognized the fragile being, whose form had seemed to bend even to the summer breeze, in the energetic man, whose very excess of sensibility rendered him more capable of fulfilling his station of pilot in storm tossed England."
1,"It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the winds, or confine a mountain stream with a straw."
1,"I feel that I know what ought to be done, and as my presence is necessary for the accomplishment of my plans, I will take especial care to preserve my life."
1,Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.
1,Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the daemon.
1,He loved her for her beauty and for her amiable disposition but he seemed to love her more for what he considered her superior wisdom.
1,"In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain."
1,"That drink will plunge us in a sweet slumber, and when we awaken what joy will be ours to find all our sorrows and fears past."
1,"In such a school my disposition became rugged, but firm."
1,"Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely?"
1,He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike.
1,"But that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it."
1,But still do I flatter myself that this would have passed away.
1,"Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator; has this mind perished?"
1,"One fine February day, when the sun had reassumed some of its genial power, I walked in the forest with my family."
1,"Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places, but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy."
1,"From the circumstances of her birth and education, Idris would have been better fitted for the formulae of ceremony; but the very ease which accompanied such actions with her, arising from habit, rendered them tedious; while, with every drawback, Perdita evidently enjoyed her situation."
1,"Their still apparent union permitted her to do much; but no woman could, in the end, present a remedy to the encreasing negligence of the Protector; who, as if seized with a paroxysm of insanity, trampled on all ceremony, all order, all duty, and gave himself up to license."
1,"Her eyes could not be deeper than they were in childhood, nor her countenance more expressive; but the expression was changed and improved; intelligence sat on her brow; when she smiled her face was embellished by the softest sensibility, and her low, modulated voice seemed tuned by love."
1,I could not refuse; for Clara was not an ordinary child; her sensibility and intelligence seemed already to have endowed her with the rights of womanhood.
1,Yet we were not all to die.
1,"Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless; rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter."
1,"""To morrow if you will."""
1,Under the influence of these circumstances his passions found a deep soil wherein they might strike their roots and flourish either as flowers or weeds as was their nature.
1,No one certainly ever enjoyed the pleasures of composition more intensely than I.
1,"We took no more sweet counsel together; and when I tried to win him again to me, his anger, and the terrible emotions that he exhibited drove me to silence and tears."
1,"He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his elder brother returns to us."
1,"I attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips."
1,"The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those mighty friends."
1,"Bless thy child even even sic in death, as I bless thee; and let me sleep at peace in my quiet grave."""
1,"Let me go, or I will tell my papa.' ""'Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.' ""'Hideous monster Let me go."
1,"I am about to leave thee; soon this living spirit which is ever busy among strange shapes and ideas, which belong not to thee, soon it will have flown to other regions and this emaciated body will rest insensate on thy bosom ""Rolled round in earth's diurnal course With rocks, and stones, and trees."
1,You are of this world; I am not.
1,"Was there indeed anarchy in the sublime universe of Adrian's thoughts, did madness scatter the well appointed legions, and was he no longer the lord of his own soul?"
1,A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy.
1,"Beside which, his mien conquered me, and an affectionate sentiment towards him, again filled my heart I bade him command me."
1,You dream that you can restore him?
1,"From my youth I have said, I will be virtuous; I will dedicate my life for the good of others; I will do my best to extirpate evil and if the spirit who protects ill should so influence circumstances that I should suffer through my endeavour, yet while there is hope and hope there ever must be, of success, cheerfully do I gird myself to my task."
1,"I knew that I must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my only guide."
1,"I asked him, if he had ever seen among the troops any one resembling her; if since he had returned to Greece he had heard of her?"
1,"""The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters."
1,Would he never overcome the fierce passion that now held pityless dominion over him?
1,"I was possessed by a maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head."
1,"""There is much truth in what you say,"" said I, ""and yet no man ever acts upon this theory."
1,She accused herself of his journey to Greece his dangers his imprisonment.
1,"Morning broke; and the old woman saw the corpse, marked with the fatal disease, close to her; her wrist was livid with the hold loosened by death."
1,"The old woman shuddered, she contrived at length to sit upright; but her teeth chattered, and her knees knocked together close, very close, lay a half naked figure, just discernible in the gloom, and the cry for water and the stifled moan were again uttered."
1,I know not what we are to hope; but there is some good beyond us that we must seek; and that is our earthly task.
1,"But while I endured punishment and pain in their defence with the spirit of an hero, I claimed as my reward their praise and obedience."
1,"He paused, and was lost in thought."
1,"""Entertain this belief,"" he cried, ""hug it to your heart make it a pillow to your head, an opiate for your eyes I am content."
1,"He was gay, playful, fascinating but never did he overstep the modesty of nature, or the respect due to himself, in his wildest sallies."
1,"Among better natures, anguish and dread, the fear of eternal separation, and the awful wonder produced by unprecedented calamity, drew closer the ties of kindred and friendship."
1,"I stood watching the scene, while Adrian flitted like a shadow in among them, and, by a word and look of sobriety, endeavoured to restore order in the assembly."
1,"Other feelings, less ambiguous, were called into play by his conciliating manner and the generous warmth of his expressions, respect rarely before experienced, admiration, and love he had touched my rocky heart with his magic power, and the stream of affection gushed forth, imperishable and pure."
1,But now also I began to reap the fruits of my perfect solitude.
1,"The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer."
1,"We both agreed in loving Adrian: although she not having yet escaped from childhood could not appreciate as I did the extent of his merits, or feel the same sympathy in his pursuits and opinions."
1,"I was not angry on my own account, but I felt as if the praises which this idol received were leaves torn from laurels destined for Adrian."
1,"Clara, overcome by weariness, had seated herself at the foot of her cousin's bed, and in spite of her efforts slumber weighed down her lids; twice or thrice she shook it off; but at length she was conquered and slept."
1,"""I loved you I love you neither anger nor pride dictates these lines; but a feeling beyond, deeper, and more unalterable than either."
1,The gamekeepers were more enraged than their lord by my obstinacy.
1,"I sank to the ground, and my injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood."
1,"We marked the difference of character among the boys, and endeavoured to read the future man in the stripling."
1,"Time is no more, for I have stepped within the threshold of eternity; each man I meet appears a corse, which will soon be deserted of its animating spark, on the eve of decay and corruption."
1,By day and night these thoughts pursued me.
1,CHAPTER I. HEAR YOU not the rushing sound of the coming tempest?
1,She prayed for her husband's soul; she conjured the Supreme to place on her head the crime of his self destruction she vowed to live to expiate his fault.
1,"Elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was in the greatest danger."
1,C Fletcher's comedy of the Captain.
1,"""Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power."
1,I was alone the whole evening.
1,"How sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as I am It removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin."""
1,"No unseemly sights were therefore discernible: the shops were in general open, the concourse of passengers in some degree kept up."
1,We were for ever together; and the subjects of our conversations were inexhaustible.
1,I cannot say with what passion I loved every thing even the inanimate objects that surrounded me.
1,"They seldom addressed each other, shunning explanation, each fearing any communication the other might make."
1,"But they tell us that the curse of God is on the place, for every one who has ventured within the walls has been tainted by the plague; that this disease has spread in Thrace and Macedonia; and now, fearing the virulence of infection during the coming heats, a cordon has been drawn on the frontiers of Thessaly, and a strict quarantine exacted."""
1,To some among the poor this was matter of exultation.
1,"After so much time spent in painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils."
1,"Orphans, in the fullest sense of the term, we were poorest among the poor, and despised among the unhonoured."
1,The maniac became composed; his person rose higher; authority beamed from his countenance.
1,They were fond of the sweet orphan.
1,"He perceived the cloud gathering, and tried to dissipate it; but the strength of my feelings would not permit me to pass thus lightly over this sacred subject; so I said emphatically, ""Permit me to remark, that I am devotedly attached to the Earl of Windsor; he is my best friend and benefactor."
1,"The cold is excessive, and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation."
1,I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information.
1,"I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions."
1,"Her ugly sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn."
1,"He entered the churches, and foretold to the congregations their speedy removal to the vaults below."
1,"He had begun his speech with vehemence; he ended with unassuming gentleness, making his appeal with the same humility, as if he had asked to be the first in wealth, honour, and power among Englishmen, and not, as was the truth, to be the foremost in the ranks of loathsome toils and inevitable death."
1,"When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix."
1,"He was induced to look with extreme disapprobation, and at last with distaste, on my father's imprudence and follies."
1,"It was, indeed, a filthy process in which I was engaged."
1,Encourage the people by your presence.
1,I mentioned this to Perdita.
1,My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery.
1,"During the early part of my life there is little to relate, and I will be brief; but I must be allowed to dwell a little on the years of my childhood that it may be apparent how when one hope failed all life was to be a blank; and how when the only affection I was permitted to cherish was blasted my existence was extinguished with it."
1,"AND now let the reader, passing over some short period of time, be introduced to our happy circle."
1,"The high born ladies of the country would have deemed themselves disgraced if they had now enjoyed, what they before called a necessary, the ease of a carriage."
1,"The old man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music."
1,"After the scene sketched in the preceding pages, Perdita had contemplated an entire change in the manners and conduct of Raymond."

1,"No flowers lifted up their dew laden cups to meet the dawn; the dry grass had withered on the plains; the burning fields of air were vacant of birds; the cicale alone, children of the sun, began their shrill and deafening song among the cypresses and olives."

1,"I am a farce and play to him, but to me this is all dreary reality: he takes all the profit and I bear all the burthen."

1,"About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother in law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o'clock, they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port."
1,"You can blast my other passions, but revenge remains revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery."
1,"I was like a wild beast that had broken the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a stag like swiftness."

1,"It had been a favourite resort of Adrian; it was secluded; and he often said that in boyhood, his happiest hours were spent here; having escaped the stately bondage of his mother, he sat on the rough hewn steps that led to the spring, now reading a favourite book, now musing, with speculation beyond his years, on the still unravelled skein of morals or metaphysics."
1,"""Alas"" said the old man, who gave me this account with tears in his eyes, ""it wrings my heart to see my lord in this state: when I heard that he was coming down here with you, my young lady, I thought we should have the happy days over again that we enjoyed during the short life of my lady your mother But that would be too much happiness for us poor creatures born to tears and that was why she was taken from us so soon; she was too beautiful and good for us."

1,"If, under any circumstances, she could have acquired sufficient courage to address the noble persons mentioned by her husband, the ill success of his own application caused her to banish the idea."
1,"Her head fell on his shoulder, she trembled, alternate changes of fire and ice ran through her limbs: observing her emotion he spoke with softened accents: ""The blow is given."
1,"The raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors."
1,"I should there find solitude where I might weep, and the voices of life might never reach me."

1,"This poor man, learned as La Place, guileless and unforeseeing as a child, had often been on the point of starvation, he, his pale wife and numerous offspring, while he neither felt hunger, nor observed distress."
1,I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me.
1,At length I gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.
1,"Doubtless you have both heard the current tale; perhaps believe the slander; but he is not mad Were an angel from the foot of God's throne to assert it, never, never would I believe it."
1,For this I had deprived myself of rest and health.
1,"Return; dearest one, you promised me this boon, that I should bring you health."
1,"I see him now, excellent and venerable old man His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their delight his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain."
1,"Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable."
1,My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.
1,"It was as the ass and the lap dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration."

1,"Here I met Georgio Palli, the vice admiral of the Greek fleet, a former friend and warm partizan of Raymond."
1,"Perdita listened to me impatiently, and answered with some asperity: ""Do you think that any of your arguments are new to me? or that my own burning wishes and intense anguish have not suggested them all a thousand times, with far more eagerness and subtlety than you can put into them?"
1,"The favoured countries of the south will throw off the iron yoke of servitude; poverty will quit us, and with that, sickness."
1,"Never will I give up my search until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support."

1,"A youth passed in solitude, my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services."
1,"When the seasons have become equal, when the air breeds no disorders, when its surface is no longer liable to blights and droughts, then sickness will cease; when men's passions are dead, poverty will depart."

1,I entreated Adrian to return to me after he had conducted his sister home.
1,"His astronomical theories absorbed him; calculations were scrawled with coal on the bare walls of his garret: a hard earned guinea, or an article of dress, was exchanged for a book without remorse; he neither heard his children cry, nor observed his companion's emaciated form, and the excess of calamity was merely to him as the occurrence of a cloudy night, when he would have given his right hand to observe a celestial phenomenon."
1,"Love of the Greek people, appetite for glory, and hatred of the barbarian government under which he had suffered even to the approach of death, stimulated him."

1,"I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services."
1,"He was naturally frank; the continued absence of Perdita and myself became remarkable; and Raymond soon found relief from the constraint of months, by an unreserved confidence with his two friends."
1,"Its pleasant places were deserted; its temples and palaces were converted into tombs; its energies, bent before towards the highest objects of human ambition, were now forced to converge to one point, the guarding against the innumerous arrows of the plague."
1,"To a crown, a golden be gemmed crown, I hope; and yet I dare not trust and though I dream of a crown and wake for one, ever and anon a busy devil whispers to me, that it is but a fool's cap that I seek, and that were I wise, I should trample on it, and take in its stead, that which is worth all the crowns of the east and presidentships of the west."""

1,Two results presented themselves in the view he took of the future.
1,"I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness."

1,"Sometimes she looked at Raymond, as if to say That it should be so At others her countenance expressed I will still do all I can to make you happy."
1,What evil might not happen in the mean time?
1,"Such is, to borrow the words of an eloquent and philosophic writer, ""the mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed of transitory parts; wherein, by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom, moulding together the great mysterious incorporation of the human race, the whole, at one time, is never old, or middle aged, or young, but, in a condition of unchangeable constancy, moves on through the varied tenour of perpetual decay, fall, renovation, and progression."""
1,"At the same time, Lord Raymond, by some unlooked for chance, became the possessor of an immense fortune in England, whither he returned, crowned with glory, to receive the meed of honour and distinction before denied to his pretensions."
1,You purpose to kill me.
1,I awoke from disturbed dreams.
1,"Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel."" ""My dear father, reassure yourself."
1,"My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me."
1,"This good woman had stood in the place of a mother, and her very deficiencies of education and knowledge, by rendering her humble and defenceless, endeared her to us she was the especial favourite of the children."
1,"""I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge."
1,"She answered my reasonings more briefly, declaring with disdain, that the reason was hers; and, until I could persuade her that the past could be unacted, that maturity could go back to the cradle, and that all that was could become as though it had never been, it was useless to assure her that no real change had taken place in her fate."
1,"The better sort of houses were shut up; the busy trade of the town palsied; there was an air of anxiety among the few passengers I met, and they looked wonderingly at my carriage the first they had seen pass towards London, since pestilence sat on its high places, and possessed its busy streets."
1,"The genius that enlightened her countenance, was now united to an expression of benevolence, which gave divine perfection to her beauty."

1,Oh Not the ten thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution.
1,I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely.
1,"My life was spent among tangible realities, hers was a dream."
1,"While life was strong within me I thought indeed that there was a sacred horror in my tale that rendered it unfit for utterance, and now about to die I pollute its mystic terrors."

1,"He promised that he would come and see me again; and bade me take cheer, and to encourage what happy thoughts I could, untill time and fortitude should overcome my misery, and I could again mingle in society."
1,"Assuredly he had not conned his lesson; and at first he hesitated, pausing in his ideas, and in the choice of his expressions."
1,Yet this was very unlike my early life although as then I was confined to Nature and books.
1,"I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval."
1,To escape these evils was the aim and scope of all our exertions.
1,"Sometimes she observed the war of elements, thinking that they also declared against her, and listened to the pattering of the rain in gloomy despair."
1,I quitted him to take a few hours rest.
1,"They did not now guess at, and totter on the pathway, divining the mode to please, hoping, yet fearing the continuance of bliss."
1,Such was the maniac language of her enthusiasm.
1,"Like a refreshing shower on an arid soil they revived me, and although I still kept their cause secret he led me to pour forth my bitter complaints and to clothe my woe in words of gall and fire."
1,"I could never, while with him, think of his bounty as a remedy to my poverty; and I even put aside hastily his offers of supplies, assuring him of a falsehood, that I needed them not."
1,I remembered in one of her harshest moments a quotation of mine had roused her to anger and disdain.
1,"There was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her."
1,"Will you tell him that he must excuse me to day, for I am not well."
1,"Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke."
1,"Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates."
1,"Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean."
1,I had certainly acted imprudently.
1,But sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me.
1,Oh that I had words to express the luxury of death that I might win you.
1,"Grey headed men, ye hoped for yet a few years in your long known abode but the lease is up, you must remove children, ye will never reach maturity, even now the small grave is dug for ye mothers, clasp them in your arms, one death embraces you"" Shuddering, he stretched out his hands, his eyes cast up, seemed bursting from their sockets, while he appeared to follow shapes, to us invisible, in the yielding air ""There they are,"" he cried, ""the dead They rise in their shrouds, and pass in silent procession towards the far land of their doom their bloodless lips move not their shadowy limbs are void of motion, while still they glide onwards."
1,"The way in which Adrian had received his project for setting him up as a candidate for the Protectorship, and his replies, had already awakened in his mind, the view of the subject which we were now discussing."
1,"O blessed sleep Often, when most miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture."
1,"Oh God help me Let him be alive It is all dark; in my abject misery I demand no more: no hope, no good: only passion, and guilt, and horror; but alive Alive My sensations choked me No tears fell yet I sobbed, and breathed short and hard; one only thought possessed me, and I could only utter one word, that half screaming was perpetually on my lips; Alive Alive I had taken the steward with me for he, much better than I, could make the requisite enquiries the poor old man could not restrain his tears as he saw my deep distress and knew the cause he sometimes uttered a few broken words of consolation: in moments like these the mistress and servant become in a manner equals and when I saw his old dim eyes wet with sympathizing tears; his gray hair thinly scattered on an age wrinkled brow I thought oh if my father were as he is decrepid hoary then I should be spared this pain When I had arrived at the nearest town I took post horses and followed the road my father had taken."
1,"Less wonder far is it, that the garrison, despairing of being able to hold out longer, should take advantage of the negligence of our fleet to escape at once from siege and capture."

1,Who deserved the hand of this self exalted king more than she whose glance belonged to a queen of nations?
1,England was still secure.
1,"Perdita was to become the pupil, friend and younger sister of Evadne."
1,"Heavy falls of snow gave an arctic appearance to the scenery; the roofs of the houses peeped from the white mass; the lowly cot and stately mansion, alike deserted, were blocked up, their thresholds uncleared; the windows were broken by the hail, while the prevalence of a north east wind rendered out door exertions extremely painful."
1,"But it will please me to see you each day to listen to the public voice praising you; to keep up your paternal love for our girl; to hear your voice; to know that I am near you, though you are no longer mine."
1,It became a question whether he had fallen among the unrecognized; but no broken ornament or stained trapping betrayed his fate.
1,"In this state I was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that I had lost."
1,"Anguish deprived her of presence of mind; she gave up to me and Clara the physician's and nurse's parts; she sat by the bed, holding one little burning hand, and, with glazed eyes fixed on her babe, passed the long day in one unvaried agony."
1,"""Do you cabal also against me,"" said he, laughing; ""and will you make common cause with Raymond, in dragging a poor visionary from the clouds to surround him with the fire works and blasts of earthly grandeur, instead of heavenly rays and airs?"
1,"When she became a widow, she turned all her thoughts to the educating her son Adrian, second Earl of Windsor, so as to accomplish her ambitious ends; and with his mother's milk he imbibed, and was intended to grow up in the steady purpose of re acquiring his lost crown."
1,You have cast yourself from among us and you wither on this wild plain forlorn and helpless: some dreadful calamity must have befallen you.
1,"I put my hand before my eyes, and cried out in agony, ""Oh Take him away I cannot see him; for God's sake, do not let him enter"" Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance."
1,"Cries of horror filled the place every one endeavoured to effect his escape in a few minutes the market place was cleared the corpse lay on the ground; and the maniac, subdued and exhausted, sat beside it, leaning his gaunt cheek upon his thin hand."
1,Perdita's name was not mentioned; yet I could not doubt that love for her caused the vacillation of purpose that he exhibited.
1,"I sought the little bed of my darling; he was oppressed by fever; but I trusted, I fondly and fearfully trusted, that there were no symptoms of the plague."
1,"""This is going too far,"" her mother answered, with quivering lips, and eyes again instinct by anger."
1,"Towards the end of October it dwindled away, and was in some degree replaced by a typhus, of hardly less virulence."
1,"I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame."
1,"This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes."
1,"We descended from Parnassus, emerging from its many folds, and passed through Livadia on our road to Attica."
1,"This ironical tone was discord to my bursting, over boiling heart; I was nettled by his insolence, and replied with bitterness; ""There is a spirit, neither angel or devil, damned to limbo merely."""
1,"We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw Mont Saleve, the pleasant banks of Montalegre, and at a distance, surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it."
1,My aunt was only relieved of her anxiety concerning his fate by a letter from him dated Hamburgh.
1,"The cavern shape the stage assumed, the beetling rocks, the glare of the fire, the misty shades that crossed the scene at times, the music in harmony with all witch like fancies, permitted the imagination to revel, without fear of contradiction, or reproof from reason or the heart."
1,We accordingly rested on a seat until they should return.
1,The lower and vagabond English joined with them.
1,"Merrival did not join in this conversation; drawing near Idris, he proceeded to assure her that the joyful prospect of an earthly paradise after an hundred thousand years, was clouded to him by the knowledge that in a certain period of time after, an earthly hell or purgatory, would occur, when the ecliptic and equator would be at right angles."
1,"Recieve then the grateful farewell of a fleeting shadow who is about to disappear, who joyfully leaves thee, yet with a last look of affectionate thankfulness."
1,"There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection."

1,"As the earth became more desolate, her difficulty in acquiring sustenance increased; at first, her son, who lived near, had humoured her by placing articles of food in her way: at last he died."
1,"When it became noon, and the sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep."
1,"We will nominate Adrian, and do our best to bestow on him the power to which he is entitled by his birth, and which he merits through his virtues."
1,"Verney, you will acknowledge this tie, and as my brother's friend, I feel that I may trust you."""
1,"Yet this is not it I do not intend to entrap you with questions one will suffice am I completely a wretch?"""
1,"She sat at the table; one small hand shaded her eyes from the candle; the other held a pencil; her looks were fixed on a drawing before her, which Raymond recognized as the design presented to him."
1,"This also was my doing And my father's woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thrice accursed hands Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these are not your last tears Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much loved friend; he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving you he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair, I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts."
1,I built my hope on your confidence.
1,The news reached Felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure.
1,"If for a moment he shewed curiosity, my eyes fell, my voice died away and my evident suffering made him quickly endeavour to banish the ideas he had awakened; yet he for ever mingled consolation in his talk, and tried to soften my despair by demonstrations of deep sympathy and compassion."
1,This was not universal.
1,"Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night."""
1,Heaven bless you and make you so My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.
1,"In doing this, I underwent a kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained."
1,"As he walked through the wretched streets in the neighbourhood of the luckless Greek's abode, his heart smote him for the whole course of his conduct towards her."
1,We watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice.
1,"I lived in a temple glorified by intensest sense of devotion and rapture; I walked, a consecrated being, contemplating only your power, your excellence; For O, you stood beside me, like my youth, Transformed for me the real to a dream, Cloathing the palpable and familiar With golden exhalations of the dawn."
1,"As he went on I felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception, one purpose."
1,"The cup of life was poisoned forever, and although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me."
1,You promised to facilitate my visit to Adrian; I conjure you to perform your promise.
1,"About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before night the ice broke and freed our ship."
1,"But his understanding, his charity, his virtues, want a field for exercise and display; and we will procure it for him."
1,"The cleanliness, habits of order, and the manner in which our cities were built, were all in our favour."
1,"""It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant's breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village."
1,"What wonder then, in time of siege, want, extreme heat, and drought, that it should make unaccustomed ravages?"
1,"With the advance of summer, and the increase of the distemper, rents were unpaid, and their remittances failed them."
1,"I saw the brow of Idris clouded; I again felt, that we were enchained to the car of fate, over whose coursers we had no control."
1,"I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise."
1,"What, if circumstance should lead Perdita to suspect, and suspecting to be resolved?"
1,"We were told that this would not be the case; that we were by nature a poetical people, a nation easily duped by words, ready to array clouds in splendour, and bestow honour on the dust."
1,"My mother, when dying, had, in addition to her other half forgotten and misapplied lessons, committed, with solemn exhortation, her other child to my fraternal guardianship; and this one duty I performed to the best of my ability, with all the zeal and affection of which my nature was capable."
1,After we had spent a few weeks in London his attentions towards me became marked and his visits more frequent.
1,Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?
1,"How irksome were these three days to me All sleep and appetite fled from me; I could only read and re read his letter, and in the solitude of the woods imagine the moment of our meeting."
1,But in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in impotent passions.
1,"We go on, each thought linked to the one which was its parent, each act to a previous act."
1,"At the beginning of winter our Alfred, now nine years of age, first went to school at Eton."
1,"""It is a strange link in my fate that without having seen you I should passionately love you."
1,"Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me."
1,"Nature grows old, and shakes in her decaying limbs, creation has become bankrupt What wonder then, that eclipse and death have led to destruction the light of thy life, O Perdita"" CHAPTER IX."
1,I took it up and placed it in my breast.
1,"I was rich and young, and had a guardian appointed for me; and all about me would act as if I were one of their great society, while I must keep the secret that I really was cut off from them for ever."
1,"Perdita presented her to Raymond; her first words were: ""Beloved, embrace our child"" ""Come hither, sweet one,"" said her father, ""do you not know me?"" she knew his voice, and cast herself in his arms with half bashful but uncontrollable emotion."
1,"""My cousin,"" replied I, ""it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape."
1,"I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind."
1,"Some motive for which he did not account, even to himself, prevented him from relating his adventure to Perdita."
1,"""Wherefore do I feel thus?"
1,Her internal pride and humility of manner were now more than ever at war.
1,I am not yet fallen so low; my honour is not yet so tarnished.
1,"She thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate."
1,"As he went, he bought a basket of costly fruits, such as were natives of her own country, and throwing over these various beautiful flowers, bore it himself to the miserable garret of his friend."
1,While we were in London there was a harshness and sulleness in his sorrow which had now entirely disappeared.
1,"This reflection thawed my congealing blood, and again the tide of life and love flowed impetuously onward, again to ebb as my busy thoughts changed."
1,"I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as 'good,' 'dearest,' 'unhappy.'"
1,Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel houses.
1,"It is a foolish sentiment for one who is not a materialist, yet, methinks, even in that dark cell, I may feel that my inanimate dust mingles with yours, and thus have a companion in decay."""
1,"In securing solicitously an unobserved retreat in case of failure, Raymond had forgotten to arrange the mode by which she was to hear of his success; and she had been too much agitated to revert to this circumstance."
1,"I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood."
1,"She attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemper Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver."
1,She welcomed me with the greatest affection.
1,"She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly."
1,"Alas I had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not murdered my brother?"
1,The astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture.
1,"Several weeks had elapsed since the festival of the anniversary, and she had been unable to calm her mind, or to subdue her thoughts to any regular train."
1,How pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our Ernest He is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit.
1,"She had at the beginning of the season quitted the vacant city of Vienna; and, unable to tame her haughty mind to anything like submission, she had delayed at Hamburgh, and, when at last she came to London, many weeks elapsed before she gave Adrian notice of her arrival."
1,"Often I waited beside the bed of death till midnight, and through the obscurity of rainy, cloudy nights rode many miles, sustained by one circumstance only, the safety and sheltered repose of those I loved."
1,"I looked round on the audience; the females were mostly of the lower classes, but the men were of all ranks, come hither to forget awhile the protracted scenes of wretchedness, which awaited them at their miserable homes."
1,"Raymond was ten years older; to his previous beauty, noble mien, and commanding aspect, he now added gentlest benevolence, winning tenderness, graceful and unwearied attention to the wishes of another."
1,"The sea was gently agitated, now shewing a white crest, and now resuming an uniform hue; the clouds had disappeared; and dark ether clipt the broad ocean, in which the constellations vainly sought their accustomed mirror."
1,"The creaking of the masts, the clang of the wheels, the tramp above, all persuaded her that she was already far from the shores of Greece."
1,"Unsupported and weak, let him wander through fields where the unreaped corn stands in barren plenty, through copses planted by his fathers, through towns built for his use."
1,"""This is infinitely ridiculous,"" he cried, ""if you were school boys, you could not conduct yourselves more unreasonably."""
1,"I wept for a long time untill I saw him about to revive, when horror and misery again recurred, and the tide of my sensations rolled back to their former channel: with a terror I could not restrain I sprung up and fled, with winged speed, along the paths of the wood and across the fields untill nearly dead I reached our house and just ordering the servants to seek my father at the spot I indicated, I shut myself up in my own room."
1,"Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a volume of Plutarch's Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter."
1,"He had neither the ennobling self gratulation, which constancy inspires, to console him, nor the voluptuous sense of abandonment to a forbidden, but intoxicating passion."
1,"He soon conquered my latent distaste; I endeavoured to watch him and Perdita, and to keep in mind every thing I had heard to his disadvantage."
1,"He became cheerful, as he thought of this, and soberly and resolutely marked out the line of conduct he would adopt."
1,"A moment more and the old walls again met my sight, while over them hovered a murky cloud; fragments of buildings whirled above, half seen in smoke, while flames burst out beneath, and continued explosions filled the air with terrific thunders."
1,"He declared, notwithstanding her harshness, he even called it coldness, that he loved her."
1,"When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation."
1,"Our party at length broke up; ""We are all dreaming this morning,"" said Ryland, ""it is as wise to discuss the probability of a visitation of the plague in our well governed metropolis, as to calculate the centuries which must escape before we can grow pine apples here in the open air."""
1,You have loved me; I adored you.
1,"How ill you are What is the cause of all this?"" ""Do not ask me,"" cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; ""HE can tell."
1,"The plague entered the village; and, while fright and grief deprived the inhabitants of the little wisdom they possessed, old Martha stepped forward and said ""Before now I have been in a town where there was the plague."""
1,"I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate."
1,"Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also sink to rest."
1,"One only condition I would make, that you do nothing without his concurrence."""
1,"These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me."
1,"The sky was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot where my poor William had been murdered."
1,It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.
1,"I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled."
1,"If he were vanquished, I should be a free man."
1,"This spirit existed as a breath, a wish, a far off thought, until communicated to Adrian, who imbibed it with ardour, and instantly engaged himself in plans for its execution."
1,"She never mentioned her father to Perdita, she appeared half afraid when she spoke of him to me, and though I tried to draw her out on the subject, and to dispel the gloom that hung about her ideas concerning him, I could not succeed."
1,"Thus I felt, when disappointment, weariness, and solitude drove me back upon my heart, to gather thence the joy of which it had become barren."
1,I have now mentioned all my studies.
1,"A selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care."
1,I was one day seated on the verge of the clump of pines when Woodville rode past.
1,"I had passed two whole years alone unrepining, but now I was miserable."
1,Arrived at the same point of the world's age there was no difference in us; the name of parent and child had lost their meaning; young boys and girls were level now with men.
1,Evadne entered but coldly into his systems.
1,Anger made no part of his emotion.
1,Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I was reserved for vengeance.
1,"Love had doubled all her excellencies, and placed a diadem on her genius."
1,"Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her friend, rushed out of the cottage."
1,"No one ventured on board the vessel, and strange sights were averred to be seen at night, walking the deck, and hanging on the masts and shrouds."
1,"Let us go the world is our country now, and we will choose for our residence its most fertile spot."
1,"He is eloquent and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but trust him not."
1,"But in a city all is closed shut like a prison, a wiry prison from which you can peep at the sky only."
1,But the thing was now going too far.
1,"Do you remember in her infancy, with what transport you beheld Clara, recognizing in her the united being of yourself and Raymond; joying to view in this living temple a manifestation of your eternal loves."
1,"But it was not so; I was the same in strength, in earnest craving for sympathy, in my yearning for active exertion."
1,"O, yes, it would Countrymen, fear not In the still uncultivated wilds of America, what wonder that among its other giant destroyers, Plague should be numbered It is of old a native of the East, sister of the tornado, the earthquake, and the simoon."
1,"This was certainly the Sibyl's Cave; not indeed exactly as Virgil describes it, but the whole of this land had been so convulsed by earthquake and volcano, that the change was not wonderful, though the traces of ruin were effaced by time; and we probably owed the preservation of these leaves, to the accident which had closed the mouth of the cavern, and the swift growing vegetation which had rendered its sole opening impervious to the storm."
1,"The overgrown metropolis, the great heart of mighty Britain, was pulseless."
1,She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.
1,"I often wished that I had permitted her to take her own course, and engage herself in such labours for the welfare of others as might have distracted her thoughts."
1,"The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within."
1,"How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile?"
1,"And why should I describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?"
1,"I started forward and exclaimed, ""Villain Before you sign my death warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe."""
1,The effect of this scene of incantation communicated a portion of its power to that which followed.
1,"Then, as if pursued by an enemy, as if wings had been at her feet, she flew to her own apartment, she dismissed her attendants, she locked the doors, she threw herself wildly on the floor, she bit her lips even to blood to suppress her shrieks, and lay long a prey to the vulture of despair, striving not to think, while multitudinous ideas made a home of her heart; and ideas, horrid as furies, cruel as vipers, and poured in with such swift succession, that they seemed to jostle and wound each other, while they worked her up to madness."
1,For many days Adrian and Idris continued to visit me thus.
1,At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.
1,"Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence, but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and trembling, she asked, ""What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?"
1,"""Have you,"" he said, ""really spent your time in studying such nonsense?"""
1,"""I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety returns upon me as I conclude."
1,"He was perfectly self possessed; he accosted us both with courtesy, seemed immediately to enter into our feelings, and to make one with us."
1,I also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.
1,She was uncomplaining; but the very soul of fear had taken its seat in her heart.
1,"Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me."
1,"I will say no more; for I can add nothing to what I have already said, to what you before contemptuously set aside."
1,"I agreed to leave the finishing and guardianship of the tomb to the head of the religious establishment at Athens, and by the end of October prepared for my return to England."
1,"It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power."""
1,"""Merrival,"" I said, ""it is long since we have seen you you must return to Windsor with me Lady Idris desires to see you, you will not refuse her request come home with me."""
1,"The images of health and hope which I presented to her, made her with a smile consent."
1,"Her present visit to London tended to augment her state of inquietude, by shewing in its utmost extent the ravages occasioned by pestilence."
1,"She had been reserved and even stern in childhood; but love had softened the asperities of her character, and her union with Raymond had caused her talents and affections to unfold themselves; the one betrayed, and the other lost, she in some degree returned to her ancient disposition."
1,"He is a soldier, a general."
1,Woodville had told me that there was in my countenance an expression as if I belonged to another world; so he had seen that sign: and there it lay a gloomy mark to tell the world that there was that within my soul that no silence could render sufficiently obscure.
1,They were formed for one another and they soon loved.
1,"""Abhorred monster Fiend that thou art The tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes."
1,One evening a numerous assembly of Greek chieftains were gathered together in the palace.
1,"After the departure of her father, thought became impressed on her young brow."
1,He became the darling hero of this rising people.
1,"I feel yet parched with horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony."
1,"Clara often accompanied him in these excursions; partly that she might see her parents, partly because Adrian delighted in the prattle, and intelligent looks of this lovely child."
1,"Each day, before dawn, we left our night's encampment, and watched the shadows as they retreated from hill and valley, and the golden splendour of the sun's approach."
1,"Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused, when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address the court."
1,Could the demon who had I did not for a minute doubt murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?
1,"Why do you bring me out, and torture me, and tempt me, and kill me Much happier would it be for you and for me if in your frantic curiosity you tore my heart from my breast and tried to read its secrets in it as its life's blood was dropping from it."
1,"The latter had felt secure of victory, until the appearance of Raymond; and, since his name had been inserted as a candidate, he had canvassed with eagerness."
1,"""Vase am I,"" she thought, ""vase brimful of despair's direst essence."
1,"Raymond adduced many arguments and fervent persuasions to overcome her feeling, but she remained unconvinced; and, agitated by the discussion, she wildly and passionately made a solemn vow, to fly and hide herself where he never could discover her, where famine would soon bring death to conclude her woes, if he persisted in his to her disgracing offers."
1,"His countenance was rough but intelligent his ample brow and quick grey eyes seemed to look out, over his own plans, and the opposition of his enemies."
1,"I was born for something greater than I was and greater I would become; but greatness, at least to my distorted perceptions, was no necessary associate of goodness, and my wild thoughts were unchecked by moral considerations when they rioted in dreams of distinction."
1,"""It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate."
1,"But it was not so, I was yet young, Oh far too young, nor was he dead to others; but I, most miserable, must never see or speak to him again."
1,I soon arrived at the hut: the door was ajar.
1,"There are times when we have an indefinable sentiment of impending change for better or for worse, to arise from an event; and, be it for better or for worse, we fear the change, and shun the event."
1,"I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly."
1,"""That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years."
1,"I cannot lead them unwillingly to danger, and I must return."""
1,"The sadness with which the former had first heard that the plague was in London had vanished; the energy of his purpose informed his body with strength, the solemn joy of enthusiasm and self devotion illuminated his countenance; and the weakness of his physical nature seemed to pass from him, as the cloud of humanity did, in the ancient fable, from the divine lover of Semele."
1,"We became ephemera, to whom the interval between the rising and setting sun was as a long drawn year of common time."
1,Nor was it I alone who felt thus intimately his perfections.
1,"I hovered for ever around the walls of its Castle, beneath its enshadowing thickets; my sole companions were my books and my loving thoughts."
1,"""You then,"" I asked, ""still remain in Greece?"" ""Assuredly,"" replied Raymond."
1,"While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with a hasty step."
1,About this time we retired to our house at Belrive.
1,Two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and was this his first crime?
1,"Winter was hailed, a general and never failing physician."
1,"When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it."
1,"These then were the preparations for a battle, nay, the battle itself; far different from any thing the imagination had pictured."
1,"Then without further remark, she threw herself on her couch, and closing her eyes remained motionless; so that but for the deep sighs that burst from her, it would have seemed that she slept."
1,"The story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood."""
1,"An aperture in the midst let in the light of heaven; but this was overgrown with brambles and underwood, which acted as a veil, obscuring the day, and giving a solemn religious hue to the apartment."
1,"Perdita had arrived with her child at Dartford, weeping and inconsolable."
1,But her wish was of course to be complied with; and I entreated her to prepare without delay for our departure.
1,"Last Monday July st we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea room in which she floated."
1,"This change made us only the more sensible to the delights of the intimate intercourse of our own circle, the tranquillity of our divine forest, and our happy evenings in the halls of our beloved Castle."
1,"I am now going to claim the protection of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.' ""'Are they Germans?' ""'No, they are French."
1,"The wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me."
1,"The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart and depressed spirits."
1,"He assisted her to dismount, and dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage."
1,All obeyed the Lord Protector of dying England; all looked up to him.
1,"Nay, these are virtuous and immaculate beings I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on."
1,As this terrible conviction came upon him me? it melted my soul to tenderness and love I gazed on him as to take my last farewell he lay insensible his eyes closed as and? his cheeks deathly pale.
1,I left my guardian's house and I was never heard of again; it was believed from the letters that I left and other circumstances that I planned that I had destroyed myself.
1,"""You cherish dreary thoughts, my dear Perdita,"" I said, ""nor do I wonder that for a time your better reason should be influenced by passionate grief and a disturbed imagination."
1,"My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak."
1,"The same half disdainful lips and smile of triumph, the same intelligent eyes, the same brow and chestnut hair; her very hands and taper fingers resembled his."
1,"I forgot the distance between us: ""I will go with thee, Raymond"" I cried; but, my eye removed from the glass, I could scarce discern the pigmy forms of the crowd, which about a mile from me surrounded the gate; the form of Raymond was lost."
1,"The door of the house from which these sounds proceeded was open, the upper rooms were illuminated as for a feast."
1,"Believe me, he was destined to be the author of infinite good to his native England."
1,"Not with Raymond, who was unconscious of the misery he occasioned; not with Evadne, for her his soul wept tears of blood poor, mistaken girl, slave not tyrant was she, and amidst his own anguish he grieved for her future destiny."
1,"He was all animation; you could no longer trace in his look of health, the suffering valetudinarian; from his smile and sprightly tones you could not guess that he was about to lead forth from their native country, the numbered remnant of the English nation, into the tenantless realms of the south, there to die, one by one, till the LAST MAN should remain in a voiceless, empty world."
1,"Turn from me, if you will, if you can."
1,"When night came again I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees."
1,I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.
1,Great God What agony I endured.
1,Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place.'
1,"Her person was formed in the most feminine proportions; she was not tall, but her mountain life had given freedom to her motions, so that her light step scarce made her foot fall heard as she tript across the hall to meet me."
1,"In the same way, individuals may escape ninety nine times, and receive the death blow at the hundredth; because bodies are sometimes in a state to reject the infection of malady, and at others, thirsty to imbibe it."
1,Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.
1,I had begun my journey with anxious haste; now I desired to draw it out through the course of days and months.
1,"Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.'"
1,"He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish, combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes."
1,"Once a writing of his fell into Perdita's hands; it was blotted with tears well might any blot it with the like ""Life"" it began thus ""is not the thing romance writers describe it; going through the measures of a dance, and after various evolutions arriving at a conclusion, when the dancers may sit down and repose."
1,No time or space can tear from my soul that which makes a part of it.
1,Oh Sun how beautiful thou art And how glorious is the golden ocean that receives thee My heart is at peace I feel no sorrow a holy love stills my senses I feel as if my mind also partook of the inexpressible loveliness of surrounding nature What shall I do?
1,"There for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe."
1,"He remembered that he had promised Perdita to be present this very evening the th of October, anniversary of his election as Protector at a festival given in his honour."
1,"I saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and, after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed, ""Good God, papa Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor William."""
1,"Unless I had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable."
1,"I related my adventures of the night, my endeavours to find our lost one, and my disappointment."
1,More than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse.
1,"The night before, she had reached Datchet; and, prowling about, had found a baker's shop open and deserted."
1,"He scarcely appeared half his usual height; his joints were unknit, his limbs would not support him; his face was contracted, his eye wandering; debility of purpose and dastard fear were expressed in every gesture."
1,"Adrian had introduced systematic modes of proceeding in the metropolis, which, while they were unable to stop the progress of death, yet prevented other evils, vice and folly, from rendering the awful fate of the hour still more tremendous."
1,He was nearly killed with kindness.
1,Have we lost the power of rendering you happy?
1,"The flood and storms did more harm to continental Europe than to us giving, as it were, the last blow to the calamities which destroyed it."
1,"I have gazed on you as you slept, melted even to tears, as the idea filled my mind, that all I possessed lay cradled in those idolized, but mortal lineaments before me."
1,"All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa, Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies."
1,"Sometimes, indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a dungeon."
1,I am placed in the most difficult circumstances.
1,"With regard to myself, this came almost by inheritance."
1,"If mere existence, and not happiness, had been the final end of our being, what need of the profuse luxuries which we enjoy?"
1,"It is true, the populace retained themselves; but there arose a perpetual hum and bustle from the throng round the palace, which added to the noise of fireworks, the frequent explosion of arms, the tramp to and fro of horsemen and carriages, to which effervescence he was the focus, retarded his recovery."
1,"She herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer."
1,"""The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney's Ruins of Empires."
1,"She grieved for the loss of Raymond with an anguish, that exiled all smile from her lips, and trenched sad lines on her brow of beauty."

1,"I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me."

1,"Windsor is not my home; my true home I have found; the home that the Creator has prepared for me."""
1,"My heart beat quick as I approached the palings; my hand was on one of them, a leap would take me to the other side, when two keepers sprang from an ambush upon me: one knocked me down, and proceeded to inflict a severe horse whipping."
1,"Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance."
1,He looked round timidly; a mist seemed before his eyes.
1,Strange ambition this Yet such was Adrian.
1,"Her tall slim figure bent gracefully as a poplar to the breezy west, and her gait, goddess like, was as that of a winged angel new alit from heaven's high floor; the pearly fairness of her complexion was stained by a pure suffusion; her voice resembled the low, subdued tenor of a flute."
1,"I entered its gloomy walls in a fit of triumphant extasy: ""He feels me now,"" I cried, ""and shall, again and again"" I passed but one day in confinement; in the evening I was liberated, as I was told, by the order of the Earl himself."

1,"""This is mockery,"" I replied, ""you devote yourself, you, the adored brother of Idris, the being, of all the world contains, dearest to our hearts you devote yourself to an early death."
1,"I dare not hope that I have inspired you with sufficient interest that the thought of me, and the affection that I shall ever bear you, will soften your melancholy and decrease the bitterness of your tears."

1,"The vast cities of America, the fertile plains of Hindostan, the crowded abodes of the Chinese, are menaced with utter ruin."
1,They were certainly independant for neither could the good spirit allow the existence of evil or the evil one the existence of good Tired of these doubts to which I could form no probable solution Sick of forming theories which I destroyed as quickly as I built them I was one evening on the top of Hymettus beholding the lovely prospect as the sun set in the glowing sea I looked towards Athens in my heart I exclaimed oh busy hive of men What heroism what meaness exists within thy walls And alas both to the good to the wicked what incalculable misery Freemen ye call yourselves yet every free man has ten slaves to build up his freedom and these slaves are men as they are yet degraded by their station to all that is mean loathsome Yet in how many hearts now beating in that city do high thoughts live magnanimity that should methinks redeem the whole human race What though the good man is unhappy has he not that in his heart to satisfy him?

1,"God made him to have dominion over the works of his hands, and put all things under his feet."""
1,This promise drew from me the warmest thanks.
1,"A man might be respected with only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property."
1,"Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding."
1,"If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us."
1,"I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished."
1,"In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves."
1,"We did not know how far he had to go, and soon separated, supposing that in a short time he would return to the palace with Perdita, and that they would not be sorry to find themselves alone."
1,"I imagined, that it was my imperative duty to take her from scenes that thus forcibly reminded her of her loss."
1,Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
1,"Her dark hair was braided and twined in thick knots like the head dress of a Grecian statue; her garb was mean, but her attitude might have been selected as a model of grace."
1,"Her countenance was all expression; her eyes were not dark, but impenetrably deep; you seemed to discover space after space in their intellectual glance, and to feel that the soul which was their soul, comprehended an universe of thought in its ken."
1,Some gazed on these processions with wild eagerness others fled timidly some wept aloud.
1,At this period the name and exploits of one of my countrymen filled the world with admiration.
1,"Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty."

1,"We visited the north of England, my native Ulswater, and lingered in scenes dear from a thousand associations."
1,He perpetually frequented the walks that had been favourites with him when he and my mother wandered together talking of love and happiness; he collected every relick that remained of her and always sat opposite her picture which hung in the room fixing on it a look of sad despair and all this was done in a mystic and awful silence.
1,"She is very clever and gentle, and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt."
1,"I panted for enterprises beyond my childish exploits, and formed distempered dreams of future action."
1,"I put her in one of these, and entered with her that I might secure her entrance into the hospital."
1,"I then reflected, and the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my apartment might still be there, alive and walking about."
1,"Night also closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still more gloomily."
1,"The sun of youth is not set for you; it will restore vigour and life to you; do not resist with obstinate grief its beneficent influence, oh, my child bless me with the hope that I have not utterly destroyed you."
1,"His mother, apparently inattentive, at once understood what was meant, and seeing the hold we had upon her, yielded the point to us."
1,"My father was expected at noon but when I wished to return to meet him I found that I had lost my way: it seemed that in every attempt to find it I only became more involved in the intracacies of the woods, and the trees hid all trace by which I might be guided."

1,"All that he now enjoyed would have been devoid of pleasure to him, had it been unparticipated."
1,"""But it is true that I am a wretch."

1,"I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the Andes, could I when there have precipitated him to their base."
1,"Winter passed away; and spring, led by the months, awakened life in all nature."
1,"As I grew older books in some degree supplied the place of human intercourse: the library of my aunt was very small; Shakespear, Milton, Pope and Cowper were the strangley sic assorted poets of her collection; and among the prose authors a translation of Livy and Rollin's ancient history were my chief favourites although as I emerged from childhood I found others highly interesting which I had before neglected as dull."
1,"I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination.' ""'It is utterly useless,' replied Felix; 'we can never again inhabit your cottage."
1,The empire of the Mahometans in Europe was at its close.
1,"The battle was sanguinary, the loss of the Turks apparently irreparable; the Greeks, in losing one man, forgot the nameless crowd strewed upon the bloody field, and they ceased to value themselves on a victory, which cost them Raymond."
1,"I cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail image and that inconstant shade."
1,"All my joy turned to sorrow when I first beheld him with that melancholy countenance enter these doors as it were the day after my lady's funeral He seemed to recover himself a little after he had bidden me write to you but still it is a woful thing to see him so unhappy."""
1,"Meanwhile her active fancy wove a thousand combinations; she dreamt ""of moving accidents by flood and field"" she lost herself delightedly in these self created wanderings, and returned with unwilling spirit to the dull detail of common life."
1,"We stood at the door looking on this strange scene, till the dog perceiving us barked loudly; the child turned and saw us: her face."
1,Raymond strode angrily up and down the room.
1,"All my speculations and hopes are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in an eternal hell."

1,"""Do you not know, my friends,"" I said, ""that the Earl himself, now Lord Protector, visits daily, not only those probably infected by this disease, but the hospitals and pest houses, going near, and even touching the sick?"
1,"I sat by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near, said, ""Alas The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being."
1,This was superstition.
1,"And now it is ended; there is my last victim"" I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend, indignation was rekindled within me."

1,"By the time that she had with uneasy thoughts laid her fair cheek upon her pillow, her mother's servant brought a draught; a suspicion again crossed her at this novel proceeding, sufficiently alarming to determine her not to take the potion; but dislike of contention, and a wish to discover whether there was any just foundation for her conjectures, made her, she said, almost instinctively, and in contradiction to her usual frankness, pretend to swallow the medicine."
1,"Why are there fruits, or flowers, or streams, man is not here to enjoy them?"
1,"I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother, and departed."
1,"I once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting friendship."
1,"If I lift up my eyes and see the desart earth, and feel that those dear eyes have spent their mortal lustre, and that those beauteous lips are silent, their ""crimson leaves"" faded, for ever I am mute But you live, my Idris, even now you move before me There was a glade, O reader a grassy opening in the wood; the retiring trees left its velvet expanse as a temple for love; the silver Thames bounded it on one side, and a willow bending down dipt in the water its Naiad hair, dishevelled by the wind's viewless hand."
1,The Irish followed their track in disorganized multitudes; each day encreasing; each day becoming more lawless.
1,"Many living deaths have I borne for thee, O Raymond, and now I expire, thy victim By my death I purchase thee lo the instruments of war, fire, the plague are my servitors."
1,The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement.
1,"But his fate was still uncertain; she began to fear the worst, and to feel that her soul's hope was cast on a chance that might prove a blank."
1,"Poor and rich were now equal, or rather the poor were the superior, since they entered on such tasks with alacrity and experience; while ignorance, inaptitude, and habits of repose, rendered them fatiguing to the luxurious, galling to the proud, disgustful to all whose minds, bent on intellectual improvement, held it their dearest privilege to be exempt from attending to mere animal wants."
1,"I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles."
1,We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the field on which that patriot fell.
1,"It is not pestilence by the God that lives it is not either plague or impending danger that makes us, like birds in harvest time, terrified by a scarecrow, abstain from the ready prey it is base superstition And thus the aim of the valiant is made the shuttlecock of fools; the worthy ambition of the high souled, the plaything of these tamed hares But yet Stamboul shall be ours By my past labours, by torture and imprisonment suffered for them, by my victories, by my sword, I swear by my hopes of fame, by my former deserts now awaiting their reward, I deeply vow, with these hands to plant the cross on yonder mosque"" ""Dearest Raymond"" interrupted Perdita, in a supplicating accent."

1,"Then the appearance of death was distant, although the wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins."
1,"""My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken."

1,"The leafless trees spread their fibrous branches against the pure sky; their intricate and pervious tracery resembled delicate sea weed; the deer were turning up the snow in search of the hidden grass; the white was made intensely dazzling by the sun, and trunks of the trees, rendered more conspicuous by the loss of preponderating foliage, gathered around like the labyrinthine columns of a vast temple; it was impossible not to receive pleasure from the sight of these things."
1,"""Alas My father,"" said I, ""how little do you know me."
1,"I cannot number the birds that I have saved during the long and severe winters of that climate; or the hares and rabbits that I have defended from the attacks of our dogs, or have nursed when accidentally wounded."
1,"He spoke of the state of England; the necessary measures to be taken to ensure its security, and confirm its prosperity."
1,"While in London these and many other dreadful thoughts too harrowing for words were my portion: I lost all this suffering when I was free; when I saw the wild heath around me, and the evening star in the west, then I could weep, gently weep, and be at peace."

1,"Among other painful restrictions, she has occasioned it to become a law among us, never to mention Raymond's name before her."
1,"I did not tell her, that to spare her the pang of parting from inanimate objects, now the only things left, I had resolved that we should none of us return to Windsor."
1,"One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding places."
1,"And then he devoutly loved Perdita; the bend of her head, her glossy ringlets, the turn of her form were to him subjects of deep tenderness and admiration; as she spoke, her melodious tones entered his soul; he soon softened towards her, comforting and caressing her, and endeavouring to cheat himself into the belief that he had never wronged her."
1,The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion.
1,"My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine."

1,"I am struck by the storm, rooted up, laid waste: but you can stand against it; you are young and your passions are at peace."
1,"She fancied that Raymond would already be free, and that her tender attentions would come to entirely obliterate even the memory of his mischance."

1,"""Justine Moritz Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?"
1,"Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of Scotland and finish my work in solitude."
1,"I went also to act in conformity with Adrian's plans, which was to congregate in masses what remained of the population; for he possessed the conviction that it was only through the benevolent and social virtues that any safety was to be hoped for the remnant of mankind."
1,"He made a vow against love and its train of struggles, disappointment and remorse, and sought in mere sensual enjoyment, a remedy for the injurious inroads of passion."
1,Do not talk of reflection; from this moment I abjure it; this is my only happy moment during a long interval of time.
1,"Supporting her as I did, still she lagged: and at the distance of half a mile, after many stoppages, shivering fits, and half faintings, she slipt from my supporting arm on the snow, and with a torrent of tears averred that she must be taken, for that she could not proceed."
1,"Her expectations had been strongly excited; she had urged nothing against our project, on the contrary, she was evidently pleased by it; but its evident ill success changed the current of her ideas."
1,"'By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you French?' ""'No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that language only."
1,"She was submissive to those who held authority over her, but a perpetual cloud dwelt on her brow; she looked as if she expected enmity from every one who approached her, and her actions were instigated by the same feeling."
1,"In his solitary despair Adrian would often seek my sister, and in covered terms express his misery, while fortitude and agony divided the throne of his mind."
1,"Guided by a slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly."

1,"At first the increase of sickness in spring brought increase of toil to such of us, who, as yet spared to life, bestowed our time and thoughts on our fellow creatures."
1,"Above, the leaves of the beech wood cast a flickering shadow on his face, and waved in mournful melody over him I saw all these things and said, ""Aye, this is his grave"" And then I wept aloud, and raised my eyes to heaven to entreat for a respite to my despair and an alleviation for his unnatural suffering the tears that gushed in a warm healing stream from my eyes relieved the burthen that oppressed my heart almost to madness."
1,"It was not splintered by the shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood."
1,I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country.
1,"""And what is that?"" ""If I do make it my choice, then you shall know; at present I dare not speak, even think of it."""
1,"I lingered awhile, desirous of taking leave of Perdita, and from my window observed the approach of the sun."
1,We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month.
1,No delay was to ensue.

1,"It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my brother."
1,"These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native river."
1,"But they were awed as I had been, at the change of his appearance."
1,It was with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being.
1,"""I agree with you,"" replied the stranger; ""we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves such a friend ought to be do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures."
1,"He, her beloved, the sole and eternal object of her passionate tenderness, was restored her."
1,"The sun might shine or the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before."
1,"Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer."
1,He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from Constantinople to join him.
1,"May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?"" ""How is this?"
1,"How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood."
1,"My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation."
1,The monster continued to utter wild and incoherent self reproaches.
1,Consider the panic your departure will occasion.
1,"He foresaw that he should leave this cheerful earth, the lightsome sky, and thy love, Perdita; yet he neither hesitated or turned back, going right onward to his mark of fame."
1,"He descended the hill with a face beaming with triumph, and pointing with his sword to the gates, commanded his troops to down with those barricades the only obstacles now to completest victory."
1,"For myself, there was one reward I promised myself from my detested toils one consolation for my unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when, enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her."
1,"They put it into a bed and rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was quite gone."
1,I traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing.
1,"If his appearance even inspired us with hope, it only rendered the state of her mind more painful."
1,Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin.
1,"I could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval."
1,I feel death to be near at hand and I am calm.
1,"Wolves and lions, and various monsters of the desert roared against him; while the grim Unreality hovered shaking his spectral dart, a solitary but invincible assailant."
1,"This letter was enclosed to the care of a nobleman, who, he did not doubt, would perform the last and inexpensive office of placing it in the king's own hand."
1,"I had been excited to the utmost by the proceedings of the day, and now more than ever by the passionate language of Raymond."
1,"I was still smarting from my own disappointment; yet this scene oppressed me even to terror, nor could I interrupt his access of passion."
1,I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to procure.
1,As I returned my fervent hopes were dashed by so many fears; my impatience became in the highest degree painful.
1,For some time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.
1,I contracted my view to England.
1,But I wander from my relation let woe come at its appointed time; I may at this stage of my story still talk of happiness.
1,"Know yourself, Raymond, and your indignation will cease; your complacency return."
1,"Although by our situation and dispositions we were almost equally cut off from the usual forms of social intercourse, we formed a strong contrast to each other."
1,"The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea."
1,"Again he thought, how during this long month, he had avoided Perdita, flying from her as from the stings of his own conscience."
1,"I ask if in the calm of their measured reveries, if in the deep meditations which fill their hours, they feel the extasy of a youthful tyro in the school of pleasure?"
1,"""Felix trembled violently as he said this."
1,"It evidently declined, without any symptom which could lead us to suspect his disease, unless indeed his brightened eyes, animated look, and flustering cheeks, made us dread consumption; but he was without pain or fear."
1,"I now sought Adrian, anxious to hear the result of his discussion with Ryland."
1,It had been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval and yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman's sedulous attention.
1,I called on him to stay.
1,"My companion looked eagerly from one bed to the other, till at the end of the ward she espied, on a wretched bed, a squalid, haggard creature, writhing under the torture of disease."
1,"She was pale and fair, and her golden hair clustered on her temples, contrasting its rich hue with the living marble beneath."
1,This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months.
1,"Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely grateful."
1,"Again in vengeance of his wrath he falls On their great hosts, and breaks their tottering walls; Arrests their navies on the ocean's plain, And whelms their strength with mountains of the main."

1,"Again there is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin where the remains of Frankenstein still lie."
1,"Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard."
1,Yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me.
1,"Do not again speak to me in this strain; but wait in submissive patience the event of what is passing around you."" ""Oh, yes"" I passionately replied, ""I will be very patient; I will not be rash or presumptuous: I will see the agonies, and tears, and despair of my father, my only friend, my hope, my shelter, I will see it all with folded arms and downcast eyes."
1,"Although more than sixteen years had passed since her death nothing had been changed; her work box, her writing desk were still there and in her room a book lay open on the table as she had left it."
1,"Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after."
1,"Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad."
1,"She neglected even her child; shutting her heart against all tenderness, she grew reserved towards me, her first and fast friend."
1,The physical state of man would soon not yield to the beatitude of angels; disease was to be banished; labour lightened of its heaviest burden.
1,"August th, My affection for my guest increases every day."
1,"What a noble boon, worthy the giver, is the imagination it takes from reality its leaden hue: it envelopes all thought and sensation in a radiant veil, and with an hand of beauty beckons us from the sterile seas of life, to her gardens, and bowers, and glades of bliss."
1,"""I thank you, Walton,"" he said, ""for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?"
1,"He remained to combat the fiend his side unguarded, his toils unshared infection might even reach him, and he die unattended and alone."
1,"The work was soon finished; in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death."
1,"The ground on which the battle was fought, was a level plain so level, that from the tumuli you saw the waving line of mountains on the wide stretched horizon; yet the intervening space was unvaried by the least irregularity, save such undulations as resembled the waves of the sea."
1,"""But when I saw you become the object of another's love; when I imagined that you might be loved otherwise than as a sacred type and image of loveliness and excellence; or that you might love another with a more ardent affection than that which you bore to me, then the fiend awoke within me; I dismissed your lover; and from that moment I have known no peace."
1,"I knew all this and did not go to seek sympathy; but there on my solitary heath, under my lowly roof where all around was desart, it came to me as a sun beam in winter to adorn while it helps to dissolve the drifted snow."
1,"They were not expressed in words, nor even reduced to form in my own mind; but they filled my soul, exalting my thoughts, raising a glow of enthusiasm, and led me out of the obscure path in which I before walked, into the bright noon enlightened highway of mankind, making me, citizen of the world, a candidate for immortal honors, an eager aspirant to the praise and sympathy of my fellow men."
1,He entered while we were speaking.
1,A sentiment approaching happiness followed the total resignation of one's being to the guardianship of the world's ruler.
1,I cannot rule myself.
1,"You will not be dishonoured by my society, and as this is probably the last service, or disservice you can do me, will you grant my request?"""
1,"I knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, ""By the sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the daemon who caused this misery, until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict."
1,"Raymond had quitted the palace the night before; he had promised to grace the assembly, but he had not yet returned."
1,"The very boldness of his language gave him weight; each knew that he spoke truth a truth known, but not acknowledged."
1,"""I can offer you no consolation, my friend,"" said he; ""your disaster is irreparable."
1,"August , Yesterday the stranger said to me, ""You may easily perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes."
1,"I lay upon the grass surrounded by a darkness which not the slightest beam of light penetrated There was no sound for the deep night had laid to sleep the insects, the only creatures that lived on the lone spot where no tree or shrub could afford shelter to aught else There was a wondrous silence in the air that calmed my senses yet which enlivened my soul, my mind hurried from image to image and seemed to grasp an eternity."
1,"A bubbling spring prattles over stones on one side, and a plantation of a few elms and beeches, hardly deserve, and yet continue the name of wood."
1,"His wife assured us, that he had not observed any difference, except in the absence of the children from his study, and to her infinite surprise he complained of this unaccustomed quiet."
1,"I have heard him called inconstant of purpose when he deserted, for the sake of love, the hope of sovereignty, and when he abdicated the protectorship of England, men blamed his infirmity of purpose."
1,"Look at him ha I see plague She has invested his form, is incarnate in his flesh, has entwined herself with his being, and blinds his heaven seeking eyes."
1,"It was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as I was."

1,My sister's heightened colour and sparkling eyes half revealed her secret to me.
1,"The tears and agitation of my poor sister had rendered her unfit to return to the circle we had left so I persuaded her to let me drive her through the park; and, during the ride, I induced her to confide the tale of her unhappiness to me, fancying that talking of it would lighten the burthen, and certain that, if there were a remedy, it should be found and secured to her."

1,"To the generality of spectators he appeared careless of censure, and with high disdain to throw aside all dependance on public prejudices; but at the same time that he strode with a triumphant stride over the rest of the world, he cowered, with self disguised lowliness, to his own party, and although its chief never dared express an opinion or a feeling until he was assured that it would meet with the approbation of his companions."

1,"Yet, as he thus determined, fancy conjured up the miserable abode of the Greek girl."

1,"My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another."

1,"Every day added to his difficulties; the arrival of fresh vessels with emigrants, the total cessation of commerce, the starving multitude that thronged around the palace of the Protectorate, were circumstances not to be tampered with."
1,"As he spoke, his earnest eyes, fixed on me, seemed to read my very soul: my heart, my savage revengeful heart, felt the influence of sweet benignity sink upon it; while his thrilling voice, like sweetest melody, awoke a mute echo within me, stirring to its depths the life blood in my frame."
1,"They retreated, and, joining others of their companions, still fell back, till they reached the main body."
1,"Readiness of talent, a capacity of entering into, and leading the dispositions of men; earnest desire of distinction were the awakeners and nurses of his ambition."
1,"We have watched over her; nursed her flickering existence; now she has fallen at once from youth to decrepitude, from health to immedicinable disease; even as we spend ourselves in struggles for her recovery, she dies; to all nations the voice goes forth, Hope is dead We are but mourners in the funeral train, and what immortal essence or perishable creation will refuse to make one in the sad procession that attends to its grave the dead comforter of humanity?"
1,I could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery.
1,"I saw at this juncture that Raymond changed colour; his eyes were withdrawn from the orator, and cast on the ground; the listeners turned from one to the other; but in the meantime the speaker's voice filled their ears the thunder of his denunciations influenced their senses."
1,"Tears also gushed from the eyes of Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune."
1,Raymond began the conversation somewhat abruptly.
1,"She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice of half suppressed emotion, ""Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer Live, and be happy, and make others so."""
1,"He returned home, full of mingled feelings, of pain excited by Evadne's wretchedness, and pleasure at the prospect of relieving it."
1,"It was spacious, and nearly circular, with a raised seat of stone, about the size of a Grecian couch, at one end."
1,Will you accompany me to Windsor to morrow?
1,"He soon took great interest in me, and sometimes forgot his own grief to sit beside me and endeavour to cheer me."
1,"His relations of their manners, his anecdotes and descriptions of scenery whiled away delicious hours, when we were tired of talking of our own plans of future life."
1,"""Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection."
1,She was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother.
1,"When in company, sadness would in spite of every effort steal over his features, and he sat absent and mute among the busy crowd that thronged about him."
1,"When, in after times, Adrian's father, then king of England, felt his situation become more perilous, his line of conduct more embarrassed, again and again he wished for his early friend, who might stand a mound against the impetuous anger of his queen, a mediator between him and the parliament."
1,"Instances of desertion became more frequent; and even murders, which made the hearer sick with horror, where the fear of contagion had armed those nearest in blood against each other."
1,"I tenderly love these friends; I have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.'"
1,"The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be."
1,We will fight the enemy to the last.
1,"Wordsworth's ""Tintern Abbey""."
1,"I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals, should I have any fresh incidents to record."
1,"It seemed to me impossible that she could recognise the sound, but she persisted in her assertion till she gained credit with the crowd about."
1,Calderon de la Barca.
1,"I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt."
1,The earth was spread out as an highway for him; the heavens built up as a canopy for him.
1,"It is more cold within her, than a fire left by gypsies in winter time, the spent embers crowned by a pyramid of snow."
1,The rain had ceased; there was no more thunder and lightning; the wind had paused.
1,Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion.
1,The weather during our journey had been serene.
1,"""I do know you better,"" I replied ""than to think that you would be happy in such a situation; but the good you would do to others may be an inducement, since the time is probably arrived when you can put your theories into practice, and you may bring about such reformation and change, as will conduce to that perfect system of government which you delight to portray."""
1,"One moment we seized before our departure, to take leave of our beloved girls."
1,"But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south."
1,"As I waited there in expectation of that moment, I thought how, of the lovely flowers that grew there, I would wind myself a chaplet and crown myself for joy: I would sing sul margine d'un rio, my father's favourite song, and that my voice gliding through the windless air would announce to him in whatever bower he sat expecting the moment of our union, that his daughter was come."
1,Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience.
1,Perdita smiled faintly her guest left her; the carriage rolling down the street assured the final departure.
1,Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.
1,"Besides that, with the nearly extinct race of man, all our toils grew near a conclusion, she was too weak; consumption, if so it might be called, or rather the over active life within her, which, as with Adrian, spent the vital oil in the early morning hours, deprived her limbs of strength."
1,"A number of buildings and trees intervened, when I had reached the plain, hiding the city from my view."
1,I believe that without the slightest tinge of a bad heart she had the coldest that ever filled a human breast: it was totally incapable of any affection.
1,Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge.
1,"They kept better watch; I was taken, and sent to prison."
1,"The laughter died away, when a well known and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an audible whisper, ""I am satisfied, miserable wretch You have determined to live, and I am satisfied."""
1,"As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape."
1,"In the mean time, Raymond had remained with Adrian and Idris."
1,"""One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless."
1,"My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk under the tidings that I bore."
1,"Yet a feeling of awe, a breathless sentiment of wonder, a painful sense of the degradation of humanity, was introduced into every heart."
1,Where was the plague?
1,"""Do you,"" said I, ""enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous."
1,I observed the door of a small out house a jar.
1,"Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer."
1,"Better have loved despair, safer kissed her."
1,"I jumped into the boat, and well accustomed to such feats, I pushed it from shore, and exerted all my strength to row swiftly across."
1,"She saw therefore no escape from dire penury: perpetual care, joined to sorrow for the loss of the wondrous being, whom she continued to contemplate with ardent admiration, hard labour, and naturally delicate health, at length released her from the sad continuity of want and misery."
1,"Late we envied their abodes, their spicy groves, fertile plains, and abundant loveliness."
1,"Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation."
1,"She first assured him of her boundless confidence; of this he must be conscious, since but for that she would not seek to detain him."
1,"If he dies with me it is well, and there will be an end of two miserable beings; and if he will not, then will I scoff at his friendship and drink the poison before him to shame his cowardice."
1,"Yet I fear such will be my fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships."
1,"Notwithstanding the melancholy object of my journey, my spirits were exhilarated by reviving hope, by the swift motion of the airy pinnace, and the balmy visitation of the sunny air."
1,She had no experience beyond her father's cottage; and the mansion of the lord of the manor was the chiefest type of grandeur she could conceive.
1,"She and my father had been playmates from infancy: Diana, even in her childhood had been a favourite with his mother; this partiality encreased with the years of this beautiful and lively girl and thus during his school college vacations they were perpetually together."
1,"I must stay till the next day; or come back, after having reported the present state of things to the general."
1,Raymond's answer was brief.
1,Almost fainting I slowly approached the fatal waters; when we had quitted the town we heard their roaring.
1,A sister of my father was with him at this period.
1,Concerning the picture she could give no account.
1,It was a life of toil; for rain and cold were more frequent than sunshine; but it was my pride to contemn the elements.
1,"What had been hardly won, was now, entirely possessed, doubly dear."
1,"Rome, and Florence, and Pisa were overflowed, and their marble palaces, late mirrored in tranquil streams, had their foundations shaken by their winter gifted power."
1,"Under the idea of initiating me in the scene of English politics and society, of which I was soon to become a part, he narrated a number of anecdotes, and sketched many characters; his discourse, rich and varied, flowed on, pervading all my senses with pleasure."
1,"To tell all my grief I might as well attempt to count the tears that have fallen from these eyes, or every sign that has torn my heart."
1,"Wordsworth has compared a beloved female to two fair objects in nature; but his lines always appeared to me rather a contrast than a similitude: A violet by a mossy stone Half hidden from the eye, Fair as a star when only one Is shining in the sky."
1,"When first she left her peasant life, and resided with the elegant and cultivated Evadne, the only accomplishment she brought to any perfection was that of painting, for which she had a taste almost amounting to genius."
1,We took leave of them in the Protectoral Palace.
1,"Elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, ""My dearest friend, you must calm yourself."
1,"From the top of the mound, I looked far round all was silent and deserted."
1,"In spite of the misery I deprecated, and could not understand; in spite of the cold hearths of wide London, and the corpse strewn fields of my native land; in spite of all the variety of agonizing emotions I had that evening experienced, I thought that in reply to our melodious adjurations, the Creator looked down in compassion and promise of relief; the awful peal of the heaven winged music seemed fitting voice wherewith to commune with the Supreme; calm was produced by its sound, and by the sight of many other human creatures offering up prayers and submission with me."
1,"He was an inferior actor, but truth now made him excellent; as he went on to announce to Macduff the slaughter of his family, he was afraid to speak, trembling from apprehension of a burst of grief from the audience, not from his fellow mime."
1,"Shall the daughter of the noble, though prodigal Zaimi, appear a beggar before her compeers or inferiors superiors she had none."
1,"Still Perdita would expect him; he wrote a few incoherent words on a scrap of paper, testifying that he was well, and bade the woman of the house take it to the palace, and deliver it into the hands of the wife of the Lord Protector."
1,"Our evening march, more calm, was yet more delightful than the morning restlessness of spirit."
1,"A letter came unawares, Perdita read it."
1,"Alas who is safe, if she be convicted of crime?"
1,"""Your affectionate and afflicted father, ""Alphonse Frankenstein."
1,"Thus I might proclaim myself a madman, but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim."
1,"And morning and evening my tearful eyes raised to heaven, my hands clasped tight in the energy of prayer, I have repeated with the poet Before I see another day Oh, let this body die away Let me not be reproached then with inutility; I believed that by suicide I should violate a divine law of nature, and I thought that I sufficiently fulfilled my part in submitting to the hard task of enduring the crawling hours minutes in bearing the load of time that weighed miserably upon me and that in abstaining from what I in my calm moments considered a crime, I deserved the reward of virtue."
1,"""They shout,"" I said, ""because they will soon return to England."" ""Do you, then, really return?"" ""Alas Yes; I cannot withstand their demands."
1,"He won me over to his party, heart and soul."
1,"Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible."
1,He endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued.
1,"They studied, they rode together; they were never seperate and seldom admitted a third to their society."
1,But you have a husband and lovely children; you may be happy.
1,"I wandered on, and the coming darkness made every trace indistinct by which I might be guided."
1,A call for the boat to be lowered was echoed from the deck.
1,"Even at this early age, he was deep read and imbued with the spirit of high philosophy."
1,"Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers."
1,"I was so entirely wrapt in this reverie that I wandered on, taking no heed of my steps until I actually stooped down to gather a flower for my wreath on that bleak plain where no flower grew, when I awoke from my day dream and found myself I knew not where."
1,"A short conversation passed between us, but the next day he again stopped at my cottage and by degrees an intimacy grew between us."
1,"The latter name made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated."
1,"At every inn where we changed horses we heard of him, and I was possessed by alternate hope and fear."
1,"""And my brother?"" ""Is on deck, Madam."""
1,"Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair."
1,"Yet I will not die; alas how dare I go where I may meet Diana, when I have disobeyed her last request; her last words said in a faint voice when all feeling but love, which survives all things else was already dead, she then bade me make her child happy: that thought alone gives a double sting to death."
1,"And I, the nearest kinsman of the Earl of Windsor, was to propose his election."
1,But why approach my chamber?
1,"For a moment the poor girl fancied that her mother believed that she had drank poison: she was on the point of springing up; when the Countess, already at a distance from the bed, spoke in a low voice to her companion, and again Idris listened: ""Hasten,"" said she, ""there is no time to lose it is long past eleven; they will be here at five; take merely the clothes necessary for her journey, and her jewel casket."""
1,"But I disdained the artifice; or rather in my wretchedness it was my only consolation to pour out my heart to you, my brother, my only friend."
1,"""This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it."
1,"He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European."
1,"""Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me."
1,"As I approached the latter, she seized my hand, and drew me into another apartment; she threw herself into my arms, and wept and sobbed bitterly and long."
1,"I shall commit my thoughts to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling."
1,"But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any kind."""
1,Three years ago and on that day and hour it shone through the branches and leaves of the beech wood and its beams flickered upon the countenance of him whom I then beheld for the last time.
1,"Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my departure for Ingolstadt."
1,He wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes.
1,"My first thought was Perdita; to her I must return; her I must support, drawing such food from despair as might best sustain her wounded heart; recalling her from the wild excesses of grief, by the austere laws of duty, and the soft tenderness of regret."
1,"Nov. th It is only four o'clock; but it is winter and the sun has already set: there are no clouds in the clear, frosty sky to reflect its slant beams, but the air itself is tinged with a slight roseate colour which is again reflected on the snow that covers the ground."
1,"The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had succeeded."
1,She feared to lose sight of him; yet she dreaded to remark any change in the temper of his mind.
1,"I said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been broken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart."
1,"I left her, and soon heard that she slept soundly under the influence of the opiate I had administered."
1,"The mind of Raymond was not so rough cast, nor had been so rudely handled, in the circumstance of life, as to make him proof to these considerations on the contrary, he was all nerve; his spirit was as a pure fire, which fades and shrinks from every contagion of foul atmosphere: but now the contagion had become incorporated with its essence, and the change was the more painful."
1,"I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head."
1,My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide.
1,"Age and care had furrowed her cheeks, and bent her form; but her eye was still bright, her manners authoritative and unchanged; she received her daughter coldly, but displayed more feeling as she folded her grand children in her arms."
1,"There I shrunk and fled from him, now I only wished to be with him that I might soothe him to peace."
1,I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.
1,"""When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover, but to prepare to return to her native country."
1,I am not immortal; and the thread of my history might be spun out to the limits of my existence.
1,"The usual expression of his eyes was soft, though at times he could make them even glare with ferocity; his complexion was colourless; and every trait spoke predominate self will; his smile was pleasing, though disdain too often curled his lips lips which to female eyes were the very throne of beauty and love."
1,"After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay."
1,A diplomatist: one among the pleasure seeking society of a gay city; a youth of promise; favourite of the Ambassador.
1,"I read the histories of Greece and Rome, and of England's former periods, and I watched the movements of the lady of my heart."
1,"My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's thirst for knowledge."
1,"""No; he quitted the house before four this morning."""
1,"He sat by her, he took her hand, and said a thousand things which breathed the deepest spirit of compassion and affection."
1,"My life was like that of an animal, and my mind was in danger of degenerating into that which informs brute nature."
1,"His health was impaired beyond hope of cure; and it became his earnest wish, before he died, to preserve his daughter from the poverty which would be the portion of her orphan state."
1,"She looked at the hand writing, which she could not mistake, and repeated to herself the words ""Do not, I charge you, I entreat you, permit your guests to wonder at my absence:"" the while the old crone going on with her talk, filled her ear with a strange medley of truth and falsehood."
1,"I had before experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the heart sickening despair that I then endured."
1,"He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his companions followed him at some distance."
1,He meditated on what was best to be done.
1,"We walked together in the gardens and in the evening when I would have retired he asked me to stay and read to him; and first said, ""When I was last here your mother read Dante to me; you shall go on where she left off."""
1,"She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her determination."
1,How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief?
1,"Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise."
1,"His birth pleased the aristocracy; his being the candidate recommended by Adrian, a man intimately allied to the popular party, caused a number, who had no great reliance either on the Duke or Mr. Ryland, to range on his side."
1,Raymond started angrily when he saw me.
1,"The tent of the Arab is fallen in the sands, and his horse spurns the ground unbridled and unsaddled."
1,"This picture is gone, and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed."
1,One paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.
1,"At length our tranquillity was disturbed, and the course of events, which for five years had flowed on in hushing tranquillity, was broken by breakers and obstacles, that woke us from our pleasant dream."
1,I came in during the interval between the third and fourth act.
1,"They had received orders that if I were again taken, I should be brought to the Earl; and his lenity made them expect a conclusion which they considered ill befitting my crime."
1,"With the same wary prudence that characterized her whole conduct, she concealed her discovery, but hastened to remove her son from the sphere of the attractive Greek."
1,But to convince you that selfish feeling does not entirely engross me I shall remain in this town untill you have made by letter every arrangement that you judge necessary.
1,"Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door."
1,"We call the supernal lights fixed, yet they wander about yonder plain, and if I look again where I looked an hour ago, the face of the eternal heavens is altered."
1,In the university whither I was going I must form my own friends and be my own protector.
1,"The balloon rose about half a mile from the earth, and with a favourable wind it hurried through the air, its feathered vans cleaving the unopposing atmosphere."
1,"Even music was not wanting: banners floated in the air, and the shrill fife and loud trumpet breathed forth sounds of encouragement and victory."
1,"Such had been Ryland's plan, and he was discovered dead and half devoured by insects, in a house many miles from any other, with piles of food laid up in useless superfluity."
1,"He deserved it all all labour, all devotion, all sacrifice; I would have toiled up a scaleless Alp, to pluck a flower that would please him."
1,Evening approached and I beheld the sun set.
1,We passed through busy towns and cultivated plains.
1,"He received a letter from her to say that she was slightly ill, but telling him to hasten to her, that from his eyes she would receive health and that his company would be her surest medecine."
1,"I had acquired in my harp a companion in rainy days; a sweet soother of my feelings when any untoward accident ruffled them: I often addressed it as my only friend; I could pour forth to it my hopes and loves, and I fancied that its sweet accents answered me."
1,Who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me?
1,"My frame is strong, but my soul sinks beneath this endurance of living anguish."
1,"We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather."
1,"I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around."
1,"First he was to visit Evadne, and then to hasten to the palace of the Protectorate."
1,"The girl was called 'sister' or 'Agatha,' and the youth 'Felix,' 'brother,' or 'son.'"
1,"He had appeared each evening, impatience and anger marked in his looks, scowling on us from the opposite side of St. Stephen's, as if his mere frown would cast eclipse on our hopes."
1,"This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend his eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly I was roused by half a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin."
1,"Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever."
1,"Raymond and I made a part of the concert, and Adrian and Perdita were devout listeners."
1,"I have said that he was a poet: when he was three and twenty years of age he first published a poem, and it was hailed by the whole nation with enthusiasm and delight."
1,"Because I was mountain bred, unallied to the noble and wealthy, shall he think to repay me by an empty name and station?"
1,I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.
1,"Sometimes you may be stung with the feeling that you have wronged me, but the condolence of your relatives, the pity of the world, the complacency which the consciousness of your own immaculate innocence will bestow, will be excellent balm; me you will never see more"" Raymond moved towards the door."
1,"Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix."
1,"My thoughts were sad and solemn, yet not of unmingled pain."
1,"In some degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month."
1,"After one or two trivial remarks, to which I sullenly replied, he suddenly cried, looking at the bust, ""I am called like that victor Not a bad idea; the head will serve for my new coinage, and be an omen to all dutiful subjects of my future success."""
1,As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.
1,"If I survive, and she be lost, I were far better dead."
1,Was my love blamable?
1,Yet I do not pretend to account for my mood by any particular event.
1,"I have no right to play with his feelings, to accept his proffered love, and then sting him with neglect."""
1,"Raymond expressed himself delighted to see him, declaring that he should make one in the festivity of the night."
1,"Might he not many, many years hence, when age had quenched the burning sensations that he now experienced, might he not then be again a father to me?"
1,"With all the incongruities of his character, Raymond was emphatically a man of the world."
1,"""As to the likelihood of escaping,"" said Adrian, ""ten years hence the cold stars may shine on the graves of all of us; but as to my peculiar liability to infection, I could easily prove, both logically and physically, that in the midst of contagion I have a better chance of life than you."
1,He was now our Lord Protector.
1,You perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine.
1,"The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion."
1,"Thus, while Perdita was entertaining her guests, and anxiously awaiting the arrival of her lord, his ring was brought her; and she was told that a poor woman had a note to deliver to her from its wearer."
1,Many things I read surpassed my understanding and experience.
1,Few people had discovered some cowardice and much infirmity of purpose under this imposing exterior.
1,"I was for some time ignorant of this and thought that my excessive weakness was the consequence of the fever; sic But my strength became less and less; as winter came on I had a cough; and my sunken cheek, before pale, burned with a hectic fever."
1,"I LIVED far from the busy haunts of men, and the rumour of wars or political changes came worn to a mere sound, to our mountain abodes."
1,"Her unhappiness assumed every day a new shape; every day some unexpected event seemed to close, while in fact it led onward, the train of calamities which now befell her."
1,"But let me, it is my last entreaty, let me in the praises of his countrymen and the prosperity of England, find the choice of my youth justified."""
1,Sometimes she felt proud that he had preferred her to the hopes of a crown.
1,"I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been, have made me what I am."
1,"I was placed in a remote part of the house, and only saw my aunt at stated hours."
1,The appearance of the plain was changed during this short interval; the encampment was broken up; the relics of the disbanded army met in small companies here and there; each face was clouded; every gesture spoke astonishment and dismay.
1,"Trembling, I was unable to continue to look through the glass with which I had watched the motion of the crew, when the frigate's boat had first been launched."
1,"We rapidly drew near, so that at length the number and forms of those within could be discerned; its dark sides grew big, and the splash of its oars became audible: I could distinguish the languid form of my friend, as he half raised himself at our approach."
1,"I have defended it with my sword, and was willing that my spirit should be breathed out in its defence; freedom is of more worth than life, and the Greeks do well to defend their privilege unto death."
1,"His connection with Adrian and Perdita was never mentioned; he was to her a meteor, a companionless star, which at its appointed hour rose in her hemisphere, whose appearance brought felicity, and which, although it set, was never eclipsed."
1,"And then again she became aware of her own excellencies, and began to balance with juster scales the shades of good and evil."
1,Even Perdita was unable to understand me.
1,"You, my creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing?"
1,"What do you intend to do?"" ""To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses."""
1,"The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred."
1,"This was the first commencement of my friendship with Adrian, and I must commemorate this day as the most fortunate of my life."
1,My hand was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself.
1,"But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine."
1,"""I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring."
1,"I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed."""
1,"The men disdainfully repelled the idea of having deserted the defence of their city; and one, the youngest among them, in answer to the taunt of a sailor, exclaimed, ""Take it, Christian dogs take the palaces, the gardens, the mosques, the abode of our fathers take plague with them; pestilence is the enemy we fly; if she be your friend, hug her to your bosoms."
1,"If, therefore, I could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth."
1,"But, come, this splenetic fit is already passed; resume your functions; your partizans will hail you; your enemies be silenced; our love, honour, and duty will again be manifested towards you."
1,Would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy?
1,"Raymond felt no relief, received no pleasure from any show of heaven or earth."
1,"When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my stay."
1,"As I came, dressed in white, covered only by my tartan rachan, my hair streaming on my shoulders, and shooting across with greater speed that it could be supposed I could give to my boat, my father has often told me that I looked more like a spirit than a human maid."
1,"He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone."
1,The district which contained them appeared the abode of every kindly spirit.
1,"Plague might not revive with the summer; but if it did, it should find us prepared."
1,"O ye heart strings of mine, could ye be torn asunder, and my soul not spend itself in tears of blood for sorrow Idris, after the first shock, regained a portion of fortitude."
1,"I will be brief for there is in all this a horror that will not bear many words, and I sink almost a second time to death while I recall these sad scenes to my memory."
1,"I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the room in the extremest agitation."
1,"""'Do you consider,' said his companion to him, 'that you will be obliged to pay three months' rent and to lose the produce of your garden?"
1,"To have him once more in my arms, to see him, however changed, is all I desire."
1,It is hard for one so young who was once so happy as I was; sic voluntarily to divest themselves of all sensation and to go alone to the dreary grave; I dare not.
1,"A short month has destroyed a village, and where in May the first person sickened, in June the paths were deformed by unburied corpses the houses tenantless, no smoke arising from the chimneys; and the housewife's clock marked only the hour when death had been triumphant."
1,I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking.
1,What could not this man achieve in the busy English world?
1,"What may not the forces, never before united, of liberty and peace achieve in this dwelling of man?"" ""Dreaming, for ever dreaming, Windsor"" said Ryland, the old adversary of Raymond, and candidate for the Protectorate at the ensuing election."
1,"With simplicity and courage she set aside the prejudices and opposition which were obstacles to my happiness, nor scrupled to give her hand, where she had given her heart."
1,You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings.
1,"My daily vows rose for revenge a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured."
1,"With sails abaft, the engine stopt, the vessel remained unwillingly stationary, until, after an hour's search, my poor Perdita was brought on board."
1,I must collect my thoughts.
1,"In this mood of mind I betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration."
1,"But if the sentiment on which the fabric of her existence was founded, became common place through participation, the endless succession of attentions and graceful action snapt by transfer, his universe of love wrested from her, happiness must depart, and then be exchanged for its opposite."
1,"Their numbers ably arranged; the very deaths among them concealed; moving on in good order, and apparently given up to enjoyment, they excited the envy of the Irish."
1,Pisando la tierra dura de continuo el hombre esta y cada passo que da es sobre su sepultura.
1,"He would come triumphantly to the district to which my parent had fled broken hearted; he would find the ill fated offspring, bequeathed with such vain confidence to his royal father, miserable paupers."
1,"My father pointed out these circumstances with a serious and unaltered mien, only now and then fixing his deep and liquid eyes upon me; there was something strange and awful in his look that overcame me, and in spite of myself I wept, nor did he attempt to console me, but I saw his lips quiver and the muscles of his countenance seemed convulsed."
1,Already she fears for us.
1,The course of the Rhine below Mainz becomes much more picturesque.

1,"Their incursion would hardly have been felt had they come alone; but the Irish, collected in unnatural numbers, began to feel the inroads of famine, and they followed in the wake of the Americans for England also."
1,"We, a commercial people, were obliged to bring such schemes under consideration; and the question of contagion became matter of earnest disquisition."
1,"""The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest."""
1,"AFTER a long interval, I am again impelled by the restless spirit within me to continue my narration; but I must alter the mode which I have hitherto adopted."
1,"Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual happiness, with simple truth Do you not love another?"
1,"He said this in his most gay, yet benevolent manner, and smiled, not disdainfully, but in playful mockery of himself."
1,"They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just born."
1,"When he went as ambassador to the Northern States of America, he, for some time, planned his entire migration; and went so far as to make several journies far westward on that immense continent, for the purpose of choosing the site of his new abode."

1,"On examination, we found that all the leaves, bark, and other substances, were traced with written characters."
1,Distinction and station were not the qualifications of their election.
1,"We, descendants from the one and the other, must be enemies also."
1,"As long as their disunion remained a secret, he cherished an expectation of re awakening past tenderness in her bosom; now that we were all made acquainted with these occurrences, and that Perdita, by declaring her resolves to others, in a manner pledged herself to their accomplishment, he gave up the idea of re union as futile, and sought only, since he was unable to influence her to change, to reconcile himself to the present state of things."
1,"When night came on, she begged that Clara might sleep in a separate cabin."
1,"All the time he had passed out of England was as a dream, and all the interest of his soul, all his affections belonged to events which had happened and persons who had existed sixteen years before."
1,"When she saw who it was, she approached me and said, ""Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?"""
1,"I awoke exhausted, and finding that it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding place, and went in search of food."
1,"My sister was three years younger than myself; I had nursed her as an infant, and when the difference of our sexes, by giving us various occupations, in a great measure divided us, yet she continued to be the object of my careful love."
1,"After days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter."
1,"To you first entering on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand what I have felt and still feel?"
1,The anniversary was at hand of the exaltation of Raymond to the office of Protector; and it was customary to celebrate this day by a splendid festival.
1,"How in poor assemblage of words convey the halo of glory that surrounded her, the thousand graces that waited unwearied on her."
1,"""Be assured that earth is not, nor ever can be heaven, while the seeds of hell are natives of her soil."
1,"The tale was quickly told, but it awakened various trains of reflection."
1,"The least illness caused throes of terror; she was miserable if she were at all absent from them; her treasure of happiness she had garnered in their fragile being, and kept forever on the watch, lest the insidious thief should as before steal these valued gems."
1,I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks.
1,Idris stood at a window that over looked the park; her maternal eyes sought her own children among the young crowd.
1,"Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of any other country."
1,"""It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country man as a guide."
1,"""I talk not of others, but myself,"" replied Raymond, ""and I am as fair an example to go by as another."
1,"I called it rapture, when a smile made my heart beat; and I felt the life's blood tingle in my frame, when I approached the idol which for awhile I worshipped."
1,"The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was forever before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him."
1,"""Lionel, you hear: witness for me: persuade your sister to forgive the injury I have done her; persuade her to be mine."""
1,"Soon after, however, Felix approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances."
1,I resolved at length to accompany Perdita.
1,"He will feel highly honoured, and thus you may repay a part of the obligation I owe him, and compensate for the injuries fortune has done him."""
1,"For the will of man is omnipotent, blunting the arrows of death, soothing the bed of disease, and wiping away the tears of agony."
1,"I felt as if he had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death."
1,I was struck by the improvement that appeared in the health of Adrian.
1,"He suspected, that unaccustomed poverty was the cause of the mystery, and that the artist was unwilling to be seen in the garb and abode of want."
1,But I did not feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair.
1,"""Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time."
1,"Before it had been a rumour; but now in words uneraseable, in definite and undeniable print, the knowledge went forth."
1,Diana had torn the veil which had before kept him in his boyhood: he was become a man and he was surprised how he could ever have joined in the cant words and ideas of his fellow collegiates or how for a moment he had feared the censure of such as these.
1,"Either watching the crowd in the park, or occupied by painful reflection, we were all silent; Ryland stood by himself in an embrasure of the window; Adrian paced the hall, revolving some new and overpowering idea suddenly he stopped and said: ""I have long expected this; could we in reason expect that this island should be exempt from the universal visitation?"
1,"With all the energy of desperate grief I told him how I had fallen at once from bliss to misery; how that for me there was no joy, no hope; that death however bitter would be the welcome seal to all my pangs; death the skeleton was to be beautiful as love."
1,"""Do you then intend, now in time of peril, to recede from your duties?"" ""Duties speak rationally, my Lord when I am a plague spotted corpse, where will my duties be?"
1,"But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound."
1,"The season was May, the weather stormless; we were promised a prosperous voyage."
1,"One of these fragile mirrors, that ever doted on thine image, is about to be broken, crumbled to dust."
1,"We lie down, and close our eyes with a gentle good night, and when we wake, we are free."
1,"If our impulses were confined to hunger, thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us."
1,He came to a part of the country where he was entirely unknown and where in the deepest solitude he could converse only with his own heart.
1,A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me.
1,It were madness to calculate upon another winter.
1,"Your favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of Clerval from Geneva."
1,O wherefore are love and ruin for ever joined in this our mortal dream?
1,"A practised ear might trace an undue faltering in the step of the soldiers; but this was not occasioned so much by fear of the adversary, as by disease, by sorrow, and by fatal prognostications, which often weighed most potently on the brave, and quelled the manly heart to abject subjection."
1,I was in the wrong to commence a system of concealment; but I did it for the sake of sparing you pain; and each day has rendered it more difficult for me to alter my plan.
1,"We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on her knees."
1,"Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed."
1,"My poor love and I looked at each other, and our babes."
1,"I smiled incredulously, and replied: ""I am of Ryland's way of thinking, and will, if you please, repeat all his arguments; we shall see how far you will be induced by them, to change the royal for the patriotic style."""
1,"Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon."
1,"Her views with regard to her own children, placed all her words and actions relative to them under restraint: but Evadne was a plaything she could in no way fear; nor were her talents and vivacity slight alleviations to the monotony of the Countess's life."
1,"Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed."
1,"We were told this when young, and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place."
1,I recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.
1,"But Adrian is alone, wifeless, childless, unoccupied."
1,My skin was embrowned by the sun; my step was firm with conscious power.
1,I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves.
1,"I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a human being."
1,"Brooding over this plan, resolved when the hour should come, to propose, and insist upon its accomplishment, secure of his consent, the heart of Perdita was lightened, or rather exalted."
1,Alas why must I record the hapless delusion of this matchless specimen of humanity?
1,"This old woman had reached her hundredth year; her skin was shrivelled, her form was bent and lost in extreme decrepitude; but as still from year to year she continued in existence, out living many younger and stronger, she began to feel as if she were to live for ever."
1,"My sister was by nature destitute of the common feelings of anxious, petulant jealousy."
1,"Once, when thirteen years of age, I was sent for a month to the county jail."
1,"All resort for ambition or pleasure was cut off the streets were grass grown the houses empty the few, that from necessity remained, seemed already branded with the taint of inevitable pestilence."
1,You may see him his hair stuck with wild flowers his eyes full of untraceable meaning his voice broken his person wasted to a shadow.
1,Wherefore should this be?
1,Continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them most to support my spirits.
1,"He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind."
1,"Be it so; drag me away I return; confine me, imprison me, still I escape, and come here."
1,"After the lovers again joined me, we supped together in the alcove."
1,"I vowed, with energy and truth, to devote myself in life and death to the restoration and welfare of Adrian."
1,"""Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions."
1,"Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness."
1,Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.
1,Yet I would die to make her happy.
1,"The knowledge that I am here, rises with me in the morning, and enables me to endure the light; it is mingled with my food, which else were poison; it walks, it sleeps with me, for ever it accompanies me."
1,This professor was very unlike his colleague.
1,"""You are sorrowful, my love."
1,"The late setting of the moon, and the extreme caution I was obliged to use in this my third expedition, consumed so much time, that something like a qualm of fear came over me when I perceived dark night yield to twilight."
1,"Master yourself, Raymond, and the world is subject to you."" ""All this would be very good sense, if addressed to another,"" replied Raymond, moodily, ""con the lesson yourself, and you, the first peer of the land, may become its sovereign."
1,"Alas, what will become of us?"
1,He had gone in the carriage to the nearest town where he took a post chaise and horses with orders for the London road.
1,"An ample estate was allotted to them, and they took the first rank among the peers of Great Britain."
1,"If we survive this coming summer, I will not spend the ensuing winter in England; neither I nor any of us."""
1,"Then, with lids humid with a tear and trembling voice, she continued ""Dear friends, do not think it strange that now, visiting you for the first time, I ask your assistance, and confide my wishes and fears to you."
1,"I will not speak Be it enough for you to know that I am miserable be it enough for you to know, that the painted veil of life is rent, that I sit for ever shrouded in darkness and gloom, that grief is my sister, everlasting lamentation my mate"" I endeavoured to console her; I did not question her but I caressed her, assured her of my deepest affection and my intense interest in the changes of her fortune: ""Dear words,"" she cried, ""expressions of love come upon my ear, like the remembered sounds of forgotten music, that had been dear to me."
1,"He slowly recovered himself; yet, at last, as one might from the effects of poison, he lifted his head from above the vapours of fever and passion into the still atmosphere of calm reflection."
1,"We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich places which I had heard of even in my country."
1,With his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her.
1,"Medical aid was less easily procured, food was more difficult to obtain, and human beings, unwithheld by shame, for they were unbeheld of their fellows, ventured on deeds of greater wickedness, or gave way more readily to their abject fears."
1,"I might heap high the scale with logic, courage, and resignation but let one fear for Idris and our children enter the opposite one, and, over weighed, it kicked the beam."
1,Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability.
1,Chapter Clerval then put the following letter into my hands.
1,"Unaccustomed to industry, he knew not in what way to contribute to the support of his increasing family."
1,"In the open air alone I found relief; among nature's beauteous works, her God reassumed his attribute of benevolence, and again I could trust that he who built up the mountains, planted the forests, and poured out the rivers, would erect another state for lost humanity, where we might awaken again to our affections, our happiness, and our faith."
1,"When they separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, 'Good night sweet Safie.'"
1,"I became intimate with him, and each day afforded me occasion to admire more and more his powerful and versatile talents, that together with his eloquence, which was graceful and witty, and his wealth now immense, caused him to be feared, loved, and hated beyond any other man in England."
1,The question arose as to where we should deposit him.
1,"The ex queen gives me Idris; Adrian is totally unfitted to succeed to the earldom, and that earldom in my hands becomes a kingdom."
1,Wild beyond the imagination of the happy are the thoughts bred by misery and despair.
1,"I had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her."
1,"My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and my proficiency that of the masters."
1,"This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself."
1,"Her eyes glistened with tears when she thanked me, and the grace of her expressions was enhanced, not diminished, by the fervour, which caused her almost to falter as she spoke."
1,"At other times he worked in the garden, but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Agatha."
1,I tried to soothe her; I bade her hope; I asked what tremendous consequences would ensue even on our failure.
1,I appeal to moralists and sages.
1,"He appeared given up to contemplation, averse to excitement, a lowly student, a man of visions but afford him worthy theme, and Like to the lark at break of day arising, From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate."
1,"All in my heart was shadowy yet calm, untill my ideas became confused and at length died away in sleep."
1,"With us remained sorrow, anxiety, and unendurable expectation of evil."
1,"I had become unfit for any intercourse, even with Woodville the most gentle and sympathizing creature that existed."
1,"Will you commune less with his departed spirit, while you watch over and cultivate the rare excellence of his child?"
1,"But, even though threatened by famine, her fear of the plague was paramount; and her greatest care was to avoid her fellow creatures."
1,"They had played together as children, been the confidants of each other's little secrets, mutual aids and consolers in difficulty and sorrow."
1,"For my own part, since Adrian had first withdrawn me from my selvatic wilderness to his own paradise of order and beauty, I had been wedded to literature."
1,"Yet I smile, and sometimes I speak almost forgetful of the change I have endured."
1,"Idris, you will not act the traitor towards me?"" ""Trust me,"" replied she, ""I will preserve a strict neutrality."""
1,His good star perpetually shone upon him; a reputation had never before been made so rapidly: it was universal.
1,On every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.
1,"Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness."
1,"The wind howled; the half bare trees were despoiled of the remainder of their summer ornament; the state of the air which induced the decay of vegetation, was hostile to cheerfulness or hope."
1,"Since that period, whenever the world's circumstance has not imperiously called me away, or the temper of my mind impeded such study, I have been employed in deciphering these sacred remains."
1,"The confusion grew their looks of sorrow changed to mockery; they nodded their heads in time to the music, whose clang became maddening."
1,"They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists."
1,My attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors.
1,I shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.
1,I must not forget one incident that occurred during this visit to London.
1,"These astounding words came on him as of less fearful import than those which he had expected; and to learn that she was still in being, and that he might still hope was an alleviation to him."
1,This abode of penury may at least prove the disinterestedness of my conduct.
1,"I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject."
1,"Our joys were dearer because we saw their end; they were keener because we felt, to its fullest extent, their value; they were purer because their essence was sympathy as a meteor is brighter than a star, did the felicity of this winter contain in itself the extracted delights of a long, long life."
1,"Believe me, I will never desert life untill this last hope is torn from my bosom, that in some way my labours may form a link in the chain of gold with which we ought all to strive to drag Happiness from where she sits enthroned above the clouds, now far beyond our reach, to inhabit the earth with us."
1,"My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon."
1,"I indeed perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days' journey, I beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within me."
1,"As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found."
1,"Alas ye were the last of happiness that I ever enjoyed; a few, a very few weeks and all was destroyed."
1,"During this interval, one of the servants, happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer."
1,"The Americans permitted a few to join their band, and presently the recruits outnumbered the strangers nor did they join with them, nor imitate the admirable order which, preserved by the Trans Atlantic chiefs, rendered them at once secure and formidable."
1,"And can I who for many years was fed by tears, and nourished under the dew of grief, can I pause to relate a tale of woe and death?"
1,"Perdita would not enter Athens; but reposing at Marathon on the night of our arrival, conducted me on the following day, to the spot selected by her as the treasure house of Raymond's dear remains."
1,"Monster as I am, you are still, as you ever were, lovely, beautiful beyond expression."
1,Pareamo aver qui tutto il ben raccolto Che fra mortali in piu parte si rimembra.
1,"My friend and I had both been educated in one school, or rather I was his pupil in the opinion, that steady adherence to principle was the only road to honour; a ceaseless observance of the laws of general utility, the only conscientious aim of human ambition."
1,You say that you have lost Raymond.
1,"In Italy the rivers were unwatched by the diminished peasantry; and, like wild beasts from their lair when the hunters and dogs are afar, did Tiber, Arno, and Po, rush upon and destroy the fertility of the plains."
1,"I cannot depart without your forgiveness and I must endeavour to gain it, or I must despair."
1,"Again, with a gush of pride and delight, she marked in the features of her little girl, the same smile of beauty that often irradiated Raymond's countenance."
1,"On landing at Athens we found difficulties encrease upon us: nor could the storied earth or balmy atmosphere inspire us with enthusiasm or pleasure, while the fate of Raymond was in jeopardy."
1,"The Countess cast no look of kindness on my worn out frame, though afterwards she thanked me coldly for my attentions."
1,"Ever after this, I thought, I would live in the most dreary seclusion."
1,"Spirits of Good, behold the tears of my earnest prayer Bless my child Protect her from the selfish among her fellow creatures: protect her from the agonies of passion, and the despair of disappointment Peace, Hope and Love be thy guardians, oh, thou soul of my soul: thou in whom I breathe ""I dare not read my letter over for I have no time to write another, and yet I fear that some expressions in it might displease me."
1,"My father's impulses, never under his own controul, perpetually led him into difficulties from which his ingenuity alone could extricate him; and the accumulating pile of debts of honour and of trade, which would have bent to earth any other, was supported by him with a light spirit and tameless hilarity; while his company was so necessary at the tables and assemblies of the rich, that his derelictions were considered venial, and he himself received with intoxicating flattery."
1,"The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud."
1,"She perceived me, and looked up enquiringly; her half glance of hope was misery; the words died before I could articulate them; I felt a ghastly smile wrinkle my lips."
1,Idris could not endure to leave him in this state; nor was it right either to quit or take with us a young family for a journey of this description.
1,For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.
1,"I passed from the palace of Sweet Waters to the plain on which the encampment lay, and found its inhabitants in commotion."
1,"She also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species."
1,"I gnashed my teeth and ground them together, uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul."
1,"Raymond saw the danger; he was willing to save his troops from the crime of disobedience; for he knew, that contention once begun between the commander and his army, each act and word added to the weakness of the former, and bestowed power on the latter."
1,Were not the mightiest men of the olden times kings?
1,"She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods."
1,"It was the sight of Little Marlow, and my conversations with Martha, that led me to the plan I formed."
1,"One living beggar had become of more worth than a national peerage of dead lords alas the day than of dead heroes, patriots, or men of genius."
1,"Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night in order to complete my work."
1,His father was a narrow minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son.
1,"She was too unlike them, too utterly alien to their tastes, for them to find delight in her society, or in the prospect of its continuance, but it gave them pleasure to see her conciliating and kind."
1,"She thought he did well to assert his own will, but she wished that will to have been more intelligible to the multitude."
1,This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not.
1,The sprightly parties broke up they assembled in whispering groups.
1,"I resolved therefore to go from village to village, seeking out the rustic archon of the place, and by systematizing their exertions, and enlightening their views, encrease both their power and their use among their fellow cottagers."
1,"When he died, the tide of love resumed its ancient flow, it deluged her soul with its tumultuous waves, and she gave herself up a prey to its uncontrollable power."
1,"The extreme darkness of the stage, whose only light was received from the fire under the cauldron, joined to a kind of mist that floated about it, rendered the unearthly shapes of the witches obscure and shadowy."
1,"""He is dead"" said Adrian, as the corpse fell from his arms on the ground, and he bowed his head in sorrow and awe."
1,"My alliance with him was the pledge of my sincerity, my union with his sister, my children, his presumptive heirs, were the hostages of my truth."
1,The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep.
1,I fulfilled my commission; I saw Karazza.
1,"From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmorland."
1,"I read these words with devouring eyes; I kissed them, wept over them and exclaimed, ""He will love me"" My aunt would not undertake so long a journey, and in a fortnight we had another letter from my father, it was dated Edinburgh: he wrote that he should be with us in three days."
1,"Sometimes it made me weep; and at other times I repeated with transport those words, ""One day I may claim her at your hands."""
1,"Man existed by twos and threes; man, the individual who might sleep, and wake, and perform the animal functions; but man, in himself weak, yet more powerful in congregated numbers than wind or ocean; man, the queller of the elements, the lord of created nature, the peer of demi gods, existed no longer."
1,"Soon some people, deputed by the magistrates, came to remove the body; the unfortunate being saw a jailor in each he fled precipitately, while I passed onwards to the Castle."
1,"It was the height of his offending, that he should occasion in me such intolerable sensations, and not deign himself to afford any demonstration that he was aware that I even lived to feel them."
1,"Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep."
1,"She never caressed me, and seemed all the time I staid in the room to fear that I should annoy her by some childish freak."
1,I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel.
1,"But perfect happiness is an attribute of angels; and those who possess it, appear angelic."
1,"He replied in a hollow voice, ""Why deceive a helpless old man, why talk hypocritically to one half crazed?"
1,"But I was at once startled and enchanted by my sudden extension of vision, when the curtain, which had been drawn before the intellectual world, was withdrawn, and I saw the universe, not only as it presented itself to my outward senses, but as it had appeared to the wisest among men."
1,"Poor girl She wept when she quitted our house; she was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable for vivacity."
1,I go with the belief that I have your pardon.
1,They left me happy how unspeakably happy.
1,"But other generations will arise, and ever and for ever will continue, to be made happier by our present acts, to be glorified by our valour."
1,"The name of the Earl startled me, and caused all the indignant blood that warmed my heart to rush into my cheeks; I had never seen him before; I figured to myself a haughty, assuming youth, who would take me to task, if he deigned to speak to me, with all the arrogance of superiority."
1,"He was met on the threshold by some insult, real or imaginary; some repulse, where he least expected it; some disappointment, hard for his pride to bear."
1,"Safie nursed her with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world."
1,"She returned to the house about eight o'clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him."
1,At length the rooms began to thin.
1,"Why, all his virtues are derived from his station only; because he is rich, he is called generous; because he is powerful, brave; because he is well served, he is affable."
1,"To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm."
1,Why not for ever thus?
1,"I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe."
1,"Close to the spot on which we stood, was a solitary rock, high and conical, which, divided on every side from the mountain, seemed a nature hewn pyramid; with little labour this block was reduced to a perfect shape; the narrow cell was scooped out beneath in which Raymond was placed, and a short inscription, carved in the living stone, recorded the name of its tenant, the cause and aera of his death."
1,"However it might be, neither plague nor war could prevent Perdita from following her lord, or induce her to utter one objection to the plans which he proposed."
1,"The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations."
1,"""You speak of an almost forgotten dream,"" said Adrian, his countenance slightly clouding as he spoke; ""the visions of my boyhood have long since faded in the light of reality; I know now that I am not a man fitted to govern nations; sufficient for me, if I keep in wholesome rule the little kingdom of my own mortality."
1,"He came, therefore, sometimes to see that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long intervals."
1,"She loved him as a kind elder brother; a relation to guide, protect, and instruct her, without the too frequent tyranny of parental authority."
1,"The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited."
1,"""How cold and damp your hand is,"" said her friend; ""you are over fatigued, pray hasten to rest."""
1,"Idris was as the star, set in single splendour in the dim anadem of balmy evening; ready to enlighten and delight the subject world, shielded herself from every taint by her unimagined distance from all that was not like herself akin to heaven."
1,"My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements."
1,"What appeared to us more astonishing, was that these writings were expressed in various languages: some unknown to my companion, ancient Chaldee, and Egyptian hieroglyphics, old as the Pyramids."
1,"I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.' ""He struggled violently."
1,"Oh, this was a delicious life quite void of guile I with my dove's look and fox's heart: for indeed I felt only the degradation of falsehood, and not any sacred sentiment of conscious innocence that might redeem it."
1,"He would rather have died such a death, which will be recorded in history to endless time, than have lived to old age unknown, unhonoured."
1,"Children, unadepts in language, seldom find words to express their thoughts, nor could we tell in what manner the late events had impressed themselves on her mind."
1,"Although we were anxious to leave England before the depth of winter, yet we were detained."
1,"Here I hold communion only with the has been, and to come."
1,"These thoughts encouraged Raymond, as he stood at the door of the highest room of the house."
1,You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences.
1,"I found Merrival, the astronomer, with her."
1,I rushed into my sister's cabin; it was empty.
1,"I know, though she does not, how false the veil is which she has spread over the reality do not endeavour to rend this deceptive covering, but by degrees withdraw it."
1,"It was madness I believe, but I so worked myself up to this idea that I could think of nothing else."
1,I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.
1,He spoke with pride; he felt injured.
1,Clerval had never sympathized in my tastes for natural science; and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.
1,"I cannot describe the rapturous delight with which I turned from political brawls at home, and the physical evils of distant countries, to my own dear home, to the selected abode of goodness and love; to peace, and the interchange of every sacred sympathy."
1,Evadne now related the tale of her misfortunes.
1,Just at this time Adrian came down to us; his eager looks shewed us that he was full of some scheme.
1,"On the third day my mother sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event."
1,"But, extreme in all things, given up to immediate impressions, he entered with ardour into this new pursuit of pleasure, and followed up the incongruous intimacies occasioned by it without reflection or foresight."
1,"I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow."
1,"Still I think, that time, and even absence, may restore her to me."
1,"The chamber was full but there was no Protector; and there was an austere discontent manifest on the countenances of the leaders, and a whispering and busy tattle among the underlings, not less ominous."
1,"That fable is unjust, which gives the superiority to the sun over the wind."
1,She understood my gesture; again her head fell; again her fingers worked restlessly.
1,The debate had ended at three in the morning.
1,"The loving heart, obliged to contract its view, bestowed its overflow of affection in triple portion on the few that remained."
1,"My cheek had grown pale with study, and my person had become emaciated with confinement."
1,"But I could discover, amidst all her repinings, deep resentment towards Raymond, and an unfading sense of injury, that plucked from me my hope, when I appeared nearest to its fulfilment."
1,"The very heart and soul of Raymond and Perdita had mingled, even as two mountain brooks that join in their descent, and murmuring and sparkling flow over shining pebbles, beside starry flowers; but let one desert its primal course, or be dammed up by choaking obstruction, and the other shrinks in its altered banks."
1,"But these are precious moments; devil as I am become, yet that is my Mathilda before me whom I love as one was never before loved: and she knows it now; she listens to these words which I thought, fool as I was, would blast her to death."
1,"My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase more characteristically, of advancement in his profession."
1,"I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the fate awaiting me."
1,He had also changed my apartment; for he perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory.
1,"He sent for medical assistance; the hours passed, spun by suspense into ages; the darkness of the long autumnal night yielded to day, before her life was secure."
1,"During our ride up to town, Adrian and I discussed and argued upon Raymond's conduct, and his falling off from the hopes of permanent excellence on his part, which he had before given us cause to entertain."
1,"I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body."
1,"We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted."
1,"The port holes were open, and with every sea, which as she lurched, washed her decks, they received whole tons of water."
1,"Believe me, I was then less fitted for any communion with my fellow creatures than before."
1,"I waited for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate."
1,"Order, comfort, and even health, rose under his influence, as from the touch of a magician's wand."
1,"I approached the shore, my father held the boat, I leapt lightly out, and in a moment was in his arms."
1,"I would walk barefoot through the world, to find an uninfected spot; I would build my home on some wave tossed plank, drifted about on the barren, shoreless ocean."
1,During the whole of this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.
1,"Five months after their arrival in England, he committed suicide."
1,"I resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated and despised, every country must be equally horrible."
1,"We quitted London on the th of March and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest."
1,"I often desired his entire absence; for I found that I was grown out of the ways of life and that by long seclusion, although I could support my accustomed grief, and drink the bitter daily draught with some degree of patience, yet I had become unfit for the slightest novelty of feeling."
1,"We come,"" he exclaimed, springing forwards, ""for what should we wait?"
1,"Raymond staggered forth from this scene, as a man might do, who had been just put to the torture, and looked forward to when it would be again inflicted."
1,"I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion."
1,Why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element?
1,But I will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee.
1,"At length they began to interfere with the inhabitants, and strong in their concentrated numbers, ejected the natives from their dwellings, and robbed them of their winter store."
1,"The buds decked the trees, the flowers adorned the land: the dark branches, swollen with seasonable juices, expanded into leaves, and the variegated foliage of spring, bending and singing in the breeze, rejoiced in the genial warmth of the unclouded empyrean: the brooks flowed murmuring, the sea was waveless, and the promontories that over hung it were reflected in the placid waters; birds awoke in the woods, while abundant food for man and beast sprung up from the dark ground."
1,"I was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death."
1,"Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us."
1,"Suddenly one of the choristers died he was lifted from his desk, the vaults below were hastily opened he was consigned with a few muttered prayers to the darksome cavern, abode of thousands who had gone before now wide yawning to receive even all who fulfilled the funeral rites."
1,"Although she was elder than he by nearly two years the nature of her education made her more childish at least in the knowledge and expression of feeling; she received his warm protestations with innocence, and returned them unknowing of what they meant."
1,There were no degrees which could break my fall from happiness to misery; it was as the stroke of lightning sudden and entire.
1,"I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from someone in sport."
1,"But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention towards the cottagers."
1,"I had expected some extravagant proposition, and remained silent awhile, collecting my thoughts that I might the better combat her fanciful scheme."
1,But this was not enough.
1,"The faces of many of the inhabitants were familiar to me; in the towns, plains, hills, and defiles of these countries, I had enjoyed unspeakable delight, as I journied through them the year before."
1,"I am not one of your enemies, I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt."
1,"It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city."
1,With painful earnestness he questioned me concerning her prophecies with regard to him.
1,"We read of centre and wing in Greek and Roman history; we fancy a spot, plain as a table, and soldiers small as chessmen; and drawn forth, so that the most ignorant of the game can discover science and order in the disposition of the forces."
1,"I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas."
1,"More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest?"
1,"When the fever of my young life is spent; when placid age shall tame the vulture that devours me, friendship may come, love and hope being dead."
1,"I pressed it to my lips, while the rough soldiers gathered around, mourning over this worthiest prey of death, as if regret and endless lamentation could re illumine the extinguished spark, or call to its shattered prison house of flesh the liberated spirit."
1,"At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness."
1,"No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me my more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only."
1,"I asked, ""Does Lady Idris love you?"" ""What a question,"" replied he laughing."
1,"I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless."
1,"Fear has been said to be the parent of religion: even of that religion is it the generator, which leads its votaries to sacrifice human victims at its altars; but the religion which springs from happiness is a lovelier growth; the religion which makes the heart breathe forth fervent thanksgiving, and causes us to pour out the overflowings of the soul before the author of our being; that which is the parent of the imagination and the nurse of poetry; that which bestows benevolent intelligence on the visible mechanism of the world, and makes earth a temple with heaven for its cope."
1,"The news spread through Athens, and the whole city poured out at the gate of the Piraeus, down the roads, through the vineyards, the olive woods and plantations of fig trees, towards the harbour."
1,"She weeps continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death; her words pierce my heart."
1,"""Oh, do not listen to him,"" I cried, ""he speaks false false to himself,"" I was interrupted: and, silence being restored, we were ordered, as was the custom, to retire during the decision of the house."
1,"Methought that, Adrian withdrawn from active life, and this beauteous Idris, a victim probably to her mother's ambitious schemes, I ought to come forward to protect her from undue influence, guard her from unhappiness, and secure to her freedom of choice, the right of every human being."
1,"He had introduced himself to Adrian, by a request he made to observe some planetary motions from his glass."
1,"How altered every thing might be during that time One sudden and desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive."
1,"The night was windless, hot, and cloudy; her load became too heavy for her; and one by one she threw away her loaves, still endeavouring to get along, though her hobbling fell into lameness, and her weakness at last into inability to move."
1,"Why dost thou howl thus, O wind?"
1,"""Questo poi, no,"" said the wild looking savage, who held the torch; ""you can advance but a short distance, and nobody visits it."""
1,"It was not for the rose of Persia thou wert famous, nor the banana of the east; not for the spicy gales of India, nor the sugar groves of America; not for thy vines nor thy double harvests, nor for thy vernal airs, nor solstitial sun but for thy children, their unwearied industry and lofty aspiration."
1,"""It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire."
1,I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves.
1,"We must all remain; and do our best to help our suffering fellow creatures."""
1,"My dear sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew."""
1,Raymond promised; but then a new discussion ensued.
1,I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.
1,"My imagination hung upon the scene of recognition; his miniature, which I should continually wear exposed on my breast, would be the means and I imaged the moment to my mind a thousand and a thousand times, perpetually varying the circumstances."
1,Raymond recognized her; and his manner changed from polite beneficence to the warmest protestations of kindness and sympathy.
1,"""Shame on the country,"" said Ryland, ""to lay so much stress upon words and frippery; it is a question of nothing; of the new painting of carriage pannels and the embroidery of footmen's coats."""
1,"If the band played, involuntarily they chose airs of moderated passion; the farewell of love, or lament at absence, was followed and closed by some solemn hymn, which harmonized with the tranquil loveliness of evening, and elevated the soul to grand and religious thought."
1,"I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged."
1,He asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy.
1,"No, my Raymond, my only beloved, sole possession of Perdita This night, this splendid assembly, these sumptuous apartments, and this adornment of your tearful girl, are all united to celebrate your abdication."
1,"And how, Victor, can I relate our misfortune?"
1,"He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck, apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own."
1,"I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection."
1,"Did the sun shine on any, who could enjoy its light with purer and more intense bliss?"
1,"Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true."
1,His wisdom guided all.
1,"As I spoke I fixed my eyes upon his countenance, and his exquisite beauty, the heavenly compassion that beamed from his eyes, his gentle yet earnest look of deprecation and wonder even before he spoke wrought a change in my high strained feelings taking from me all the sterness of despair and filling me only with the softest grief."
1,"When it was decided that the young Earl of Windsor should visit Cumberland, workmen arrived to put the house and grounds in order for his reception."
1,"At such times solemn harmonies or spirit stirring airs gave wings to my lagging thoughts, permitting them, methought, to penetrate the last veil of nature and her God, and to display the highest beauty in visible expression to the understandings of men."
1,"The spirit of existence was dead within me; be not surprised therefore that when it came I welcomed not more gladly, or when it departed I lamented not more bitterly the best gift of heaven a friend."
1,"Once for a moment she revived and recognized his voice; a smile, a last lovely smile, played upon her lips."
1,"The growing shadow rose and rose, filling, and then seeming to endeavour to burst beyond, the adamantine vault that bent over, sustaining and enclosing the world."
1,"Take me mould me to your will, possess my heart and soul to all eternity."
1,I cannot see your look of deep grief without endeavouring to restore you to happier feelings.
1,"Her understanding was clear and comprehensive, her imagination vivid; she was sincere, generous, and reasonable."
1,"I rushed towards the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me, leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning, plunged into the lake."
1,"My sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas."
1,"I grew impatient, I wept; sic and wrung my hands but still I could not discover my path."
1,"He heard my account of the self dissolution of the army with calmness, and then said, ""You know, Verney, my fixed determination not to quit this place, until in the light of day Stamboul is confessedly ours."
1,He at last fell down in convulsions.
1,"I was awake, and during the long hours of dead night, my busy thoughts worked in my brain, like ten thousand mill wheels, rapid, acute, untameable."
1,"On the morning of the third day he informed me that he had determined to go to Yorkshire first alone, and that I should follow him in a fortnight unless I heard any thing from him in the mean time that should contradict this command."
1,"Yes it was despair I felt; for the first time that phantom seized me; the first and only time for it has never since left me After the first moments of speechless agony I felt her fangs on my heart: I tore my hair; I raved aloud; at one moment in pity for his sufferings I would have clasped my father in my arms; and then starting back with horror I spurned him with my foot; I felt as if stung by a serpent, as if scourged by a whip of scorpions which drove me Ah Whither Whither?"
1,"I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I may still be misled by passion."
1,Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind?
1,"He raised his eyes from the ground, but still turning them away from me, said: ""Besought by that plea I will answer your rash question."
1,The horrible scene of the preceding day was forever acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix tearing me from his father's feet.
1,"Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick."
1,"They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my course southwards."
1,I shall do nothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.
1,"The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses, passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me."
1,He related his history brief in happiness and woe and dwelt with passion on his and Elinor's mutual love.
1,"Could they thrust back from the path of distinction and laudable ambition, the heir of their ancient kings, and heap another disappointment on a fallen house."
1,"""Why, Lionel,"" said Adrian, ""what did you intend?"
1,"But neither the presence of her child, nor a subsequent visit from me, could rouse my sister."
1,On the night of her return she sickened of the plague.
1,"""One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage."
1,"You do not treat me with candour; it is not true what you say; this will not soon pass away, it will last forever if you deign not to speak to me; to admit my consolations."
1,"Attentively perusing this animated volume, I was the less surprised at the tale I read on the new turned page."
1,"The clouds become thin; an arch is formed for ever rising upwards, till, the universal cope being unveiled, the sun pours forth its rays, re animated and fed by the breeze."
1,"My fate has been governed by necessity, a hideous necessity."
1,"We resided principally in the latter, and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion."
1,"On being charged with the fact, the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner."
1,Men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation.
1,"If Idris became thin and pale, it was anxiety that occasioned the change; an anxiety I could in no way alleviate."
1,"Cast off the only gift that I have bestowed upon you, your grief, and rise from under my blighting influence as no flower so sweet ever did rise from beneath so much evil."
1,"He had sinned against his own honour, by affirming, swearing to, a direct falsehood; true this he had palmed on a woman, and it might therefore be deemed less base by others not by him; for whom had he deceived?"
1,"When I mingled with other families I distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted the development of filial love."
1,"She was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman."
1,"He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him."
1,"She continued to rave of her speedy meeting with her beloved in the grave, of his death nigh at hand; sometimes she solemnly declared that he was summoned; sometimes she bewailed his hard destiny."
1,"It would be needless to narrate those disastrous occurrences, for which a parallel might be found in any slighter visitation of our gigantic calamity."
1,You grieve because you are unhappy; it is happiness you seek but you despair of obtaining it.
1,"With great volubility, in their native Neapolitan dialect, with which we were not very familiar, they told us that there were spectres, that the roof would fall in, that it was too narrow to admit us, that there was a deep hole within, filled with water, and we might be drowned."
1,"I had tutored myself, and was resolved by no outward sign to disclose my internal agitation."
1,As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove.
1,"Greece prepared for a vigorous resistance; it rose to a man; and the women, sacrificing their costly ornaments, accoutred their sons for the war, and bade them conquer or die with the spirit of the Spartan mother."
1,"This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon Justine's innocence."
1,"The little bark to which I had beckoned had now pulled up; before I could stop her, Perdita, assisted by the sailors was in it Clara followed her mother a loud shout echoed from the crowd as we pulled out of the inner harbour; while my sister at the prow, had caught hold of one of the men who was using a glass, asking a thousand questions, careless of the spray that broke over her, deaf, sightless to all, except the little speck that, just visible on the top of the waves, evidently neared."
1,"""During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man, a servant of her father who understood French."
1,"I replied in a calm voice but how far from calm was the thought imaged by my still words ""Never I can never consent that Lady Idris should be united to one who does not love her."" ""Because you love her yourself."""
1,"We discussed the best means of preventing infection, and of preserving health and activity in a large city thus afflicted London, for instance."
1,"The busy eastern part of the town was silent, or at most you saw only where, half from cupidity, half from curiosity, the warehouses had been more ransacked than pillaged: bales of rich India goods, shawls of price, jewels, and spices, unpacked, strewed the floors."
1,Near the fire was Ryland and his supporters.
1,Could there be guilt in it?
1,"He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet."
1,"No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success."
1,"Have not actors wept, as they pourtrayed imagined passion?"
1,"Man, no longer with an appetite for sympathy, clothed his thoughts in visible signs; nor were there any readers left: while each one, having thrown away his sword with opposing shield alone, awaited the plague, Merrival talked of the state of mankind six thousand years hence."
1,"The Athenians saw in him, not as heretofore, the heroic boy or desperate man, who was ready to die for them; but the prudent commander, who for their sakes was careful of his life, and could make his own warrior propensities second to the scheme of conduct policy might point out."
1,"She was a singular being, and, like me, inherited much of the peculiar disposition of our father."
1,"I hardly know, but in a few moments I sank lifeless to the ground; and so would that then all had been at an end CHAPTER VIII I was carried to the next town: fever succeeded to convulsions and faintings, for some weeks my unhappy spirit hovered on the very verge of death."
1,"Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night."
1,"He heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had exhibited."
1,"By Heaven the first tears I have shed since boyhood rushed scalding into my eyes when I saw him."""
1,"An advanced guard gave information of our approach, and the country people were quickly in motion to do honour to Lord Raymond."
1,"I found if sorrow was dead within me, so was love and desire of sympathy."
1,He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.
1,Hereafter this will be the cynosure of Greece.
1,"His soul seemed to distil itself into the words he wrote; and they breathed on the paper, bearing with them a portion of the life of love, which was his life."
1,"I felt as if I were recreated and had about me all the freshness and life of a new being: I was, as it were, transported since his arrival from a narrow spot of earth into a universe boundless to the imagination and the understanding."
1,"so did he spring up from listlessness and unproductive thought, to the highest pitch of virtuous action."
1,"Half frightened, I would have taken her hand; but she shudderingly withdrew it, and strove to collect herself."
1,"Now, beware Be silent Do not urge me to your destruction."
1,This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.
1,"The apprehension, that Raymond had departed for ever, that his name, blended eternally with the past, must be erased from every anticipation of the future, had come slowly upon me."
1,"""As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition."
1,"It was suspected that the Turks, finding themselves possessed of so illustrious a captive, resolved to satisfy their cruelty rather than their avarice, and fearful of the interference of England, had come to the determination of concealing for ever the cold blooded murder of the soldier they most hated and feared in the squadrons of their enemy."
1,"One evening, quitting our inn, we strolled down a shady lane, then up a grassy slope, till we came to an eminence, that commanded an extensive view of hill and dale, meandering rivers, dark woods, and shining villages."
1,"The farmers and cottagers, on the contrary, struck with the fear of solitude, and madly desirous of medical assistance, flocked into the towns."
1,"I am convinced that, at the worst, he would have returned from the seashore to take leave of us, and to make us the partners of his council."
1,"Something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I will not listen to such a sinister voice."
1,"It was between six and seven o'clock, a fine summer afternoon, and I spent my leisure hours in a ramble through the empty streets of London; now turning to avoid an approaching funeral, now urged by curiosity to observe the state of a particular spot; my wanderings were instinct with pain, for silence and desertion characterized every place I visited, and the few beings I met were so pale and woe begone, so marked with care and depressed by fear, that weary of encountering only signs of misery, I began to retread my steps towards home."
1,"The aristocratical party, the richest and most influential men in England, appeared less agitated than the others, for the question was to be discussed without their interference."
1,"I know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon?"
1,"I was firmly convinced in my own mind that Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder."
1,"To be near him, to be loved by him, to feel him again her own, was the limit of her desires."
1,It may easily be imagined that I wearied myself with conjecture to guess the cause of his sorrow.
1,But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell.
1,"With sunken cheek and hollow eyes, pale and gaunt, how could I recognize the beloved of Perdita?"
1,"Youths, nobles of the land, performed for the sake of mother or sister, the services of menials with amiable cheerfulness."
1,"He quickly arranged with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian, he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding."
1,"Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin."""
1,"I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes."
1,"Raymond continued, ""I will not act a part with you, dear girl, or appear other than what I am, weak and unworthy, more fit to excite your disdain than your love."
1,"Raymond's beloved Athenians, the free, the noble people of the divinest town in Greece, fell like ripe corn before the merciless sickle of the adversary."
1,"Oh my pen haste thou to write what was, before the thought of what is, arrests the hand that guides thee."
1,"His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the world minded teach us to look for only in the imagination."
1,"Habit would not dull his sense of the enjoyment of power; nor struggles, disappointment and defeat await the end of that which would expire at its maturity."
1,"CHAPTER V. WHEN we arrived at Windsor, I found that Raymond and Perdita had departed for the continent."
1,"Then weeping, she clung to me: ""Take me to him,"" she cried, ""unkind Lionel, why do you keep me here?"
1,"With earnest gaze she looked on the labyrinth of smoking piles which had been a city, and then expressed her readiness to return home."
1,"All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears."
1,"Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to remonstrate."
1,"You have often agreed with me that there is but one solution to the intricate riddle of life; to improve ourselves, and contribute to the happiness of others: and now, in the very prime of life, you desert your principles, and shut yourself up in useless solitude."
1,"Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever varied powers of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed."""
1,The flames of the city bent beneath it; and the smoke and dust arising from the ruins was dissipated.
1,"She heard that we were bound for Greece, that she would see her father, and now, for the first time, she prattled of him to her mother."
1,"Her pallet and easel were now thrown aside; did she try to paint, thronging recollections made her hand tremble, her eyes fill with tears."
1,"It was as well to fail at last after a struggle, as to fly now at the beginning of his enterprise."
1,"The spirit of life seemed to linger in his form, as a dying flame on an altar flickers on the embers of an accepted sacrifice."
1,"One idea rushed on my mind; never, never may I speak to him again."
1,"Yet could I, in justice, or even in possibility, refuse this demand?"
1,"""Every man,"" he said, ""dreams about something, love, honour, and pleasure; you dream of friendship, and devote yourself to a maniac; well, if that be your vocation, doubtless you are in the right to follow it."""
1,"While Merrival was talking, Clara softly opened a door behind Idris, and beckoned me to come with a gesture and look of grief."
1,"At such times the king, in his enthusiasm for him, would come to his relief, and then kindly take his friend to task; my father gave the best promises for amendment, but his social disposition, his craving for the usual diet of admiration, and more than all, the fiend of gambling, which fully possessed him, made his good resolutions transient, his promises vain."
1,How shall I relate the catastrophe to so much joy; but the earth would not be the earth it is covered with blight and sorrow if one such pair as these angelic creatures had been suffered to exist for one another: search through the world and you will not find the perfect happiness which their marriage would have caused them to enjoy; there must have been a revolution in the order of things as established among us miserable earth dwellers to have admitted of such consummate joy.
1,My first real knowledge of myself was as an unprotected orphan among the valleys and fells of Cumberland.
1,"These are the reflections of the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences."
1,"Alas that in human nature such a pitch of mental discipline, and disdainful negligence of nature itself, should not have been allied to the extreme of moral excellence But the resolution that permitted her to resist the pains of privation, sprung from the too great energy of her passions; and the concentrated self will of which this was a sign, was destined to destroy even the very idol, to preserve whose respect she submitted to this detail of wretchedness."
1,"That party, however, could hardly yet be considered a minority in the kingdom, who extolled the ornament of the column, ""the Corinthian capital of polished society;"" they appealed to prejudices without number, to old attachments and young hopes; to the expectation of thousands who might one day become peers; they set up as a scarecrow, the spectre of all that was sordid, mechanic and base in the commercial republics."
1,"I began to study more; to sympathize more in the thoughts of others as expressed in books; to read history, and to lose my individuallity among the crowd that had existed before me."
1,She had to play the part of a courteous hostess; to attend to all; to shine the focus of enjoyment and grace.
1,"Many went up as high as Belfast to ensure a shorter passage, and then journeying south through Scotland, they were joined by the poorer natives of that country, and all poured with one consent into England."
1,Shall I respect man when he condemns me?
1,"We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities."
1,The massy portals of the churches swung creaking on their hinges; and some few lay dead on the pavement.
1,"She tried to rouse herself, but her eyes every now and then filled with tears, and she looked wistfully on Raymond and her girl, as if fearful that some evil would betide them."
1,The northern breeze as it refreshed me was sweeter and more balmy for it seemed to carry some of your spirit along with it.
1,"I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly."
1,"As the rules of order and pressure of laws were lost, some began with hesitation and wonder to transgress the accustomed uses of society."
1,"The light curling waves bore us onward, and old ocean smiled at the freight of love and hope committed to his charge; it stroked gently its tempestuous plains, and the path was smoothed for us."
1,"She communicated her gaiety to us, and as we amused ourselves on the Castle Terrace, it appeared that a happier, less care worn party could not have been assembled."
1,"He hurried in, and witnessed the termination of my impassioned harangue."
1,"Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards."
1,"As my authorship increased, I acquired new sympathies and pleasures."
1,"After the lapse of a few weeks, we left Dunkeld."
1,"I saw few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends."
1,"When once disease was introduced into the rural districts, its effects appeared more horrible, more exigent, and more difficult to cure, than in towns."
1,Erringly and strangely she began the task of self examination with self condemnation.
1,We went together to the House in the evening.
1,"Something told him that it was not its real evils that lay heavily at her heart, but the debasement and disgrace attendant on it; as he talked, he divested it of these; sometimes speaking of her fortitude with energetic praise; then, alluding to her past state, he called her his Princess in disguise."
1,Alas it was double cruelty in him to have chosen the sea for his fatal resolve; it was adding madness to my despair.
1,"Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment."
1,Could he be I shuddered at the conception the murderer of my brother?
1,"Some trifling business of the House having been gone through, the leaders took their seats in the chamber; the clamour of voices continued, till Ryland arose to speak, and then the slightest whispered observation was audible."
1,"Before the battle of Rodosto I was full of hope and spirit; to conquer there, and afterwards to take Constantinople, was the hope, the bourne, the fulfilment of my ambition."
1,Fortunately I had money with me.
1,"The wind, favourable to him, blew so strongly in shore, that we were unable, as we had at first intended, to meet him on his watery road."
1,"She felt struck by the plague; her aged frame was unable to bear her away with sufficient speed; and now, believing herself infected, she no longer dreaded the association of others; but, as swiftly as she might, came to her grand daughter, at Windsor Castle, there to lament and die."
1,Felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.
1,But at that moment a crash was heard.
1,"Among these, and highly distinguished by her, was Prince Zaimi, ambassador to England from the free States of Greece; and his daughter, the young Princess Evadne, passed much of her time at Windsor Castle."
1,Alas I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.
1,"You are cast out shelterless on the world: your hopes are blasted; the peace and security of your pure mind destroyed; memory will bring to you frightful images of guilt, and the anguish of innocent love betrayed."
1,"As he was proceeding along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground."
1,"And whether it were to visit beautiful scenery, or to see fine pictures, or sometimes for no object but to seek amusement as it might chance to arise, I was always happy when near my father."
1,"They are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life."
1,"I invited him to walk with me, and led him to a neighbouring wood of beech trees whose light shade shielded us from the slant and dazzling beams of the descending sun After walking for some time in silence I seated my self with him on a mossy hillock It is strange but even now I seem to see the spot the slim and smooth trunks were many of them wound round by ivy whose shining leaves of the darkest green contrasted with the white bark and the light leaves of the young sprouts of beech that grew from their parent trunks the short grass was mingled with moss and was partly covered by the dead leaves of the last autumn that driven by the winds had here and there collected in little hillocks there were a few moss grown stumps about The leaves were gently moved by the breeze and through their green canopy you could see the bright blue sky As evening came on the distant trunks were reddened by the sun and the wind died entirely away while a few birds flew past us to their evening rest."
1,"A slight circumstance induced me to alter my usual route, and to return home by Egham and Bishopgate."
1,"I left the house, the horrid scene of the last night's contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me."
1,"""I do not know,"" said the man, ""what the custom of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains."""
1,Immense glaciers approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage.
1,"""As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed."
1,"Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house."
1,"But it would not do: I rated my fortitude too high, or my love too low."
1,One other incident occurred at the end of this summer.
1,"I foresee that the plan which you mark out in your letter will not endure long; but you are mistress of yourself, and it is my sincere wish to contribute as far as you will permit me to your happiness."""
1,"I bent over the body, and took in my hand the edge of his cloak, less altered in appearance than the human frame it clothed."
1,Suddenly the system of warfare was changed.
1,"I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been."
1,"With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus."
1,The fear of so mighty a calamity as the loss of our adored infant made the current of my blood pause with chilly horror; but the remembrance of the mother restored my presence of mind.
1,"I confess, that I have not been unmoved by the development of the tale; and that I have been depressed, nay, agonized, at some parts of the recital, which I have faithfully transcribed from my materials."
1,"We lengthened our tour into Scotland, that we might see Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond; thence we crossed to Ireland, and passed several weeks in the neighbourhood of Killarney."
1,"The high walls of the tomb, and the flaming sword of plague, lie between it and him."
1,Or so my fond fancy imaged some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery forever.
1,He bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them.
1,I established myself at his bedside; I never quitted it day or night.
1,"The guides pointed to the reflection of their torches on the water that paved it, leaving us to form our own conclusion; but adding it was a pity, for it led to the Sibyl's Cave."
1,I was beyond measure disturbed by this intelligence.
1,I must absent myself from all I loved while thus employed.
1,I do not die not having enjoyed life; for sixteen years I was happy: during the first months of my father's return I had enjoyed ages of pleasure: now indeed I am grown old in grief; my steps are feeble like those of age; I have become peevish and unfit for life; so having passed little more than twenty years upon the earth I am more fit for my narrow grave than many are when they reach the natural term of their lives.
1,"But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which I feel."
1,"Look at his thought endued countenance, his graceful limbs, his majestic brow, his wondrous mechanism the type and model of this best work of God is not to be cast aside as a broken vessel he shall be preserved, and his children and his children's children carry down the name and form of man to latest time."
1,In a few words I must conclude this tragedy.
1,"The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew."
1,"The time will soon come; grief and famine have already sapped the foundations of my being; a very short time, and I shall have passed away; unstained by the crime of self destruction, unstung by the memory of degradation, my spirit will throw aside the miserable coil, and find such recompense as fortitude and resignation may deserve."
1,"Many men may scoff at his dread; but he read the future; and the peace of Perdita was too dear to him, her speechless agony too certain, and too fearful, not to unman him."
1,Could I behold this and live?
1,"At once, I seemed to awake; I cast off the clinging sloth of the past months; earth assumed a new appearance, and my view of the future was suddenly made clear."
1,"Women bear with resignation these long drawn ills, but to a man's impatient spirit, the slow motion of our cavalcade, the melancholy repose we took at noon, the perpetual presence of the pall, gorgeous though it was, that wrapt the rifled casket which had contained Raymond, the monotonous recurrence of day and night, unvaried by hope or change, all the circumstances of our march were intolerable."
1,"I was aware also that I should often lose all self command, all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation."
1,"Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased."
1,Raymond yielded for the present.
1,"The coming summer was the extreme end of our vista; and, when we arrived there, instead of a continuation of the long road, a gulph yawned, into which we must of force be precipitated."
1,"Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants."
1,"But let us go; to morrow we will arrange to ride out together, and proceeding towards that part of the forest, call upon him."""
1,"But you will, I hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge."""
1,We feared the coming summer.
1,If I fled I should be pursued; in life there was no escape for me: why then I must die.
1,As for those who in your world knew not the loveliness of benevolence justice they are placed apart some claimed by the evil spirit in vain sought for by the good but She whose delight is to reform the wicked takes all she can delivers them to her ministers not to be punished but to be exercised instructed untill acquiring a love of virtue they are fitted for these gardens where they will acquire a love of knowledge As Fantasia talked I saw various groupes of figures as they walked among the allies of the gardens or were seated on the grassy plots either in contemplation or conversation several advanced together towards the fountain where I sat As they approached I observed the principal figure to be that of a woman about years of age her eyes burned with a deep fire and every line of her face expressed enthusiasm wisdom try seemed seated on her lips which were beautifully formed every motion of her limbs although not youthful was inexpressibly graceful her black hair was bound in tresses round her head and her brows were encompassed by a fillet her dress was that of a simple tunic bound at
1,His protectorate was to be distinguished by every kind of innovation on the aristocracy.
1,"He was incapable of meeting these evils by any comprehensive system; he had resorted to expedient after expedient, and could never be induced to put a remedy in force, till it came too late to be of use."
1,"""I ask but one thing; I do not fear His hell, for I have it here; I do not desire His heaven, let me but die and be laid beside them; let me but, when I lie dead, feel my flesh as it moulders, mingle with theirs."
1,"As well might Cleopatra have worn as an ornament the vinegar which contained her dissolved pearl, as I be content with the love that Raymond can now offer me."""
1,We passed St. Paul's.
1,"Turning to him, therefore, I said, ""I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile."""
1,"As it was, the sweet girl's generous nature was roused to defend, and ally herself with, my despised cause."
1,"All my feelings, even of exultation and triumph, were changed to bitterness, if unparticipated; Perdita, even in joy, fled to loneliness, and could go on from day to day, neither expressing her emotions, nor seeking a fellow feeling in another mind."
1,"Ages perhaps had elapsed since this catastrophe; and the ruin it had made above, had been repaired by the growth of vegetation during many hundred summers."
1,"Grecian maidens will in devotion strew flowers on his tomb, and make the air around it resonant with patriotic hymns, in which his name will find high record."""
1,"His gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry."
1,"As we talked thus, I perceived that we were not going the ordinary road to Windsor, but through Englefield Green, towards Bishopgate Heath."
1,I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin.
1,"And since in the wide world thou remainest, why should I complain?"
1,"He rode through the town, visiting the wounded, and giving such orders as were necessary for the siege he meditated."
1,And thus it was that although the spirit of friendship soothed me for a while it could not restore me.
1,"""Dear Madam,"" said Adrian, ""let me entreat you to see him, to cultivate his friendship."
1,"She awaited with eagerness the return of her messenger from the palace; she listened insatiate to his account of each word, each look of the Protector; she felt bliss in this communication with her beloved, although he knew not to whom he addressed his instructions."
1,"The landlady met her in the passage; the poor creature asked, ""Is my husband here?"
1,"He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family."
1,"But curiosity soon awoke, and an earnest love of knowledge, which caused me to pass days and nights in reading and study."
1,"The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet I could not refuse."
1,"A party of people flying from London, as was frequent in those days, had come up the Thames in a boat."
1,"""You may easily believe,"" said he, ""how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book keeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: 'I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.'"
1,"You who have dedicated your powers of mind and fortune to the benefit of your species, shall you so misdirect your exertions, as to support in uselessness the strong, healthy, and capable?"""
1,Will you accompany me?
1,"I dared hardly consider you as my daughter; your beauty, artlessness and untaught wisdom seemed to belong to a higher order of beings; your voice breathed forth only words of love: if there was aught of earthly in you it was only what you derived from the beauty of the world; you seemed to have gained a grace from the mountain breezes the waterfalls and the lake; and this was all of earthly except your affections that you had; there was no dross, no bad feeling in the composition."
1,"You appeared as the deity of a lovely region, the ministering Angel of a Paradise to which of all human kind you admitted only me."
1,"After his motion had been seconded, Lord Raymond rose, his countenance bland, his voice softly melodious, his manner soothing, his grace and sweetness came like the mild breathing of a flute, after the loud, organ like voice of his adversary."
1,He found a relief to his impatient grief in the breezes of heaven and in the sound of waters and woods.
1,"The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in one pursuit."
1,"But now I went to it in cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands."
1,"Often all sounds were suspended, that we might listen to the nightingale, while the fire flies danced in bright measure, and the soft cooing of the aziolo spoke of fair weather to the travellers."
1,"The tears that suffused my sister's eyes when I mentioned our friend, and her heightened colour seemed to vouch for the truth of the reports that had reached me."
1,Its forest should be our world its garden afford us food; within its walls I would establish the shaken throne of health.
1,It was not it is not a common infidelity at which I repine.
1,"There was no Adrian to superintend and direct, while whole flocks of the poor were struck and killed."
1,"Did any one indeed exist, except I, the creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which I had let loose upon the world?"
1,"Their minister at Constantinople was urged to make the necessary perquisitions, and should his existence be ascertained, to demand his release."
1,"He sprang from the cabin window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel."
1,"""'How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?"
1,"When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished."
1,"I remained, while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight."
1,My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment.
1,"A second thought passed, swift as an arrow, into her brain; she rushed to the window; and a flash of lightning shewed to her the expected vision, her lover in the shrubbery beneath; joy lent her strength to descend the stairs, to open the door, and then she fainted in his supporting arms."
1,"First, his having entered into any engagement that should permit her to remain in such a state of degradation; and then, after a short wild dream, having left her to drear solitude, anxious conjecture, and bitter, still disappointed expectation."
1,Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous.
1,His reckless courage and comprehensive genius brought him into notice.
1,"Idris, who entertained the highest opinion of his abilities, was warmly interested in the event: and my poor sister, who dared not hope, and to whom fear was misery, was plunged into a fever of disquietude."
1,"Doubtless my words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event."
1,"My daughter, I love you"" The last words died away in a hoarse whisper, but I heard them and sunk on the ground, covering my face and almost dead with excess of sickness and fear: a cold perspiration covered my forehead and I shivered in every limb But he continued, clasping his hands with a frantic gesture: ""Now I have dashed from the top of the rock to the bottom Now I have precipitated myself down the fearful chasm The danger is over; she is alive Oh, Mathilda, lift up those dear eyes in the light of which I live."
1,"Miserable, unhappy wretch ""Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply."
1,"Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England."
1,"CHAPTER IV Among our most assiduous visitors was a young man of rank, well informed, and agreable in his person."
1,"Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix."
1,"Chapter ""Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends."
1,I hastened to carry the intelligence of these strange proceedings to Perdita; and we were soon joined by Raymond.
1,"Bitter task was it, to behold his spirit waver between death and life: to see his warm cheek, and know that the very fire which burned too fiercely there, was consuming the vital fuel; to hear his moaning voice, which might never again articulate words of love and wisdom; to witness the ineffectual motions of his limbs, soon to be wrapt in their mortal shroud."
1,"Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for whom he and his family endured such unheard of oppression, on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin, became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him, as he said, in some plan of future maintenance."
1,"""To morrow,"" said Raymond, ""his mother and sister set out for Scotland to see him once again."""
1,"And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry?"
1,His praises were so many adder's stings infixed in my vulnerable breast.
1,The Earl of Windsor became a volunteer under his friend.
1,Let not these aspirations be attributed to vanity.
1,"An unwieldy ox, who had fed in an abandoned granary, suddenly lowed, and shewed his shapeless form in a narrow door way; every thing was desert; but nothing was in ruin."
1,It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin.
1,"I was mad with excess of passionate devotion; but pride, tameless as fire, invested my nature, and prevented me from betraying myself by word or look."
1,The fear of immediate death vanished with the heats of September.
1,I must fly from him with more earnestness than from my greatest enemy: in solitude or in cities I must never more behold him.
1,"Chapter On my return, I found the following letter from my father: ""My dear Victor, ""You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you."
1,"Our eldest in some degree understood the scenes passing around, and at times, he with serious looks questioned me concerning the reason of so vast a desolation."
1,"Each individual, before a part of a great whole moving only in unison with others, now became resolved into the unit nature had made him, and thought of himself only."
1,"When the latter died this sister was taken by her maternal relations: they had seldom seen one another, and were quite unlike in disposition."
1,"She did not complain; in her brother's court she would find, not compensation for their disobedience filial unkindness admitted of none, but such a state of things and mode of life, as might best reconcile her to her fate."
1,We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food.
1,Alas Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated.
1,"Certainly the Ryland that advanced towards us now, bore small resemblance to the powerful, ironical, seemingly fearless canvasser for the first rank among Englishmen."
1,God raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst.
1,"""The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes."
1,I have longed for a friend; I have sought one who would sympathize with and love me.
1,"Adrian, whose health had always been weak, now suffered considerable aggravation of suffering from the effects of his wound."
1,Elizabeth's heart rending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer.
1,"Still he had many friends, admirers of his transcendent talents; his presence in the house, his eloquence, address and imposing beauty, were calculated to produce an electric effect."
1,"I might feel gratitude to another but I never more could love or hope as I had done; it was all suffering; even my pleasures were endured, not enjoyed."
1,Insurmountable heaps sometimes opposed themselves; the still burning fires scorched me.
1,I performed the first part of my journey on horseback.
1,"""Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family."
1,Do you think Nature composed his surpassing machine for no purpose?
1,"But these smaller and separate tragedies were about to yield to a mightier interest and, while we were promised calm from infectious influences, a tempest arose wilder than the winds, a tempest bred by the passions of man, nourished by his most violent impulses, unexampled and dire."
1,"But the powers of love, poetry, and creative fancy will dwell even beside the sick of the plague, with the squalid, and with the dying."
1,"We had lived so long in the vicinity of Eton, that its population of young folks was well known to us."
1,I felt a holy rapture spring from all I saw.
1,I called him my friend but I viewed all he did with jealous eyes.
1,"Idris could not refrain from a smile, as she listened; she had already gathered from him that his family was alive and in health; though not apt to forget the precipice of time on which she stood, yet I could perceive that she was amused for a moment, by the contrast between the contracted view we had so long taken of human life, and the seven league strides with which Merrival paced a coming eternity."
1,"They endeavoured to picture forth what would then happen, and spoke in lofty terms of the prosperity of Greece, when Constantinople should become its capital."
1,"But why should I repine at this? Misery was my element, and nothing but what was miserable could approach me; if Woodville had been happy I should never have known him."
1,"You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures.'"
1,"She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the beginning of this last winter."
1,"The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it."
1,From the moment of my mother's death untill his departure she never heard him utter a single word: buried in the deepest melancholy he took no notice of any one; often for hours his eyes streamed tears or a more fearful gloom overpowered him.
1,"Adrian's chief endeavour, after the immediate succour of the sick, had been to disguise the symptoms and progress of the plague from the inhabitants of London."
1,"Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, ""I have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries."""
1,"Genius, devotion, and courage; the adornments of his mind, and the energies of his soul, all exerted to their uttermost stretch, could not roll back one hair's breadth the wheel of time's chariot; that which had been was written with the adamantine pen of reality, on the everlasting volume of the past; nor could agony and tears suffice to wash out one iota from the act fulfilled."
1,"He was full of thought, and remained silent during a considerable part of our ride; at length he said, ""I must apologize to you for my abstraction; the truth is, Ryland's motion comes on to night, and I am considering my reply."""
1,"Such hope as theirs, we also may entertain Old fable tells us, that this gentle spirit sprung from the box of Pandora, else crammed with evils; but these were unseen and null, while all admired the inspiriting loveliness of young Hope; each man's heart became her home; she was enthroned sovereign of our lives, here and here after; she was deified and worshipped, declared incorruptible and everlasting."
1,She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived.
1,"The streets were blocked up, the ruins smoking; I climbed up one heap, only to view others in succession; and nothing told me where the centre of the town might be, or towards what point Raymond might have directed his course."
1,"It had been displayed early in life, leading her out to solitary musing among her native mountains, causing her to form innumerous combinations from common objects, giving strength to her perceptions, and swiftness to their arrangement."
1,"Gasping, not daring to name our hopes, yet full even to the brim with intense expectation, we stood, as a ship wrecked sailor stands on a barren rock islanded by the ocean, watching a distant vessel, fancying that now it nears, and then again that it is bearing from sight."
1,I looked on these; I turned my gaze to my own mean dress.
1,"""I have powers; my countrymen think well of them."
1,During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures.
1,"His limbs were nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering."
1,And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart?
1,"Willingly do I give place to thee, dear Alfred advance, offspring of tender love, child of our hopes; advance a soldier on the road to which I have been the pioneer I will make way for thee."
1,"But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death."
1,Raymond replied; but there was nothing conciliatory in his reply.
1,"When we were together I spoke little yet my selfish mind was sometimes borne away by the rapid course of his ideas; I would lift my eyes with momentary brilliancy until memories that never died and seldom slept would recur, and a tear would dim them."
1,"He Woodville, mourned the loss of his bride: others wept the various forms of misery as they visited them: but infamy and guilt was mingled with my portion; unlawful and detestable passion had poured its poison into my ears and changed all my blood, so that it was no longer the kindly stream that supports life but a cold fountain of bitterness corrupted in its very source."
1,"I sat with Perdita and soothed her, by my seeming assent to her wild scheme."
1,"""My best girl,"" he had said, ""relieves me from these phantasies."
1,"""Let me entreat Adrian,"" I cried, ""not to comply: rather join with me in endeavouring to withdraw Lord Raymond from this scene, and restore him to other society."""
1,"I was hardly more devoted to my Idris than to her brother, and she loved him as her teacher, her friend, the benefactor who had secured to her the fulfilment of her dearest wishes."
1,"He is an Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity."
1,"They went to the river to break the ice, and draw water: they assembled on foraging expeditions, or axe in hand felled the trees for fuel."
1,"I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure."
1,"Shall we, in these desart halls, under this wintry sky, sit with closed eyes and folded hands, expecting death?"
1,"When a servant came to ask me if I would take food I learnt from him that my father had returned, and was apparently well and this relieved me from a load of anxiety, yet I did not cease to weep bitterly."
1,"My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of Montanvert."
1,"My heart was full of deep affection, but it was calm from its very depth and fulness."
1,"Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the cause of the tumult."
1,"I passed through scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years."
1,"They remained confined for five months before the trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country."
1,"This being you must create."""
1,"She is a widow, and much older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with everybody."
1,The season of the assizes approached.
1,"Having effected the reunion of Raymond and Perdita, I was eager to return to England; but his earnest request, added to awakening curiosity, and an indefinable anxiety to behold the catastrophe, now apparently at hand, in the long drawn history of Grecian and Turkish warfare, induced me to consent to prolong until the autumn, the period of my residence in Greece."
1,"From the many peopled earth, from the sympathies of man, from the loved resorts of my youth, from the kindness of my friends, from the affection of my only beloved Perdita, I am about to be removed."
1,"At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I drew near my native town, I slackened my progress."
1,Perdita prepared to follow him with her child.
1,"Although he deserts his post in London, he may be of the greatest service in the north of England, by receiving and assisting travellers, and contributing to supply the metropolis with food."
1,"One man in particular stood in front, his eyes fixt on the prophet, his mouth open, his limbs rigid, while his face changed to various colours, yellow, blue, and green, through intense fear."
1,"She drifted towards the harbour, and was stranded on the sands at the entrance."
1,"""Come, I see that you have already cast aside the sad thoughts you before franticly indulged."
1,"Tumult filled the before quiet streets women and children deserted their homes, escaping they knew not whither fathers, husbands, and sons, stood trembling, not for themselves, but for their loved and defenceless relations."
1,"I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task."
1,"At length all was veiled in the deep obscurity of blackest night; I became weary and knowing that my servant was to sleep that night at the neighbouring village, so that my absence would alarm no one; and that I was safe in this wild spot from every intruder, I resolved to spend the night where I was."
1,"She studiously shut out all prospect of the future, and cradled her heart in present blessings."
1,"O, for some medicinal vial to purge unwholesome nature, and bring back the earth to its accustomed health Ryland was a man of strong intellects and quick and sound decision in the usual course of things, but he stood aghast at the multitude of evils that gathered round us."
1,"The crew, many of whom had never seen the sea before, felt indeed as if heaven and earth came ruining together, as the vessel dipped her bows in the waves, or rose high upon them."
1,In those days the rest of the world was nothing to me: all other men I never considered nor felt what they were; nor did I look on you as one of them.
1,"I did not wish to refuse them; but in my heart of hearts, I made a vow to devote life, knowledge, and power, all of which, in as much as they were of any value, he had bestowed on me all, all my capacities and hopes, to him alone I would devote."
1,"I was their plaything and their idol, and something better their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me."
1,"Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep."
1,"He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion."
1,Such was his choice: he expected to die.
1,"Shall man be the enemy of man, while plague, the foe to all, even now is above us, triumphing in our butchery, more cruel than her own?"""
1,"Do not then continue to fix your eyes on the earth; raise them on me for I can read your soul in them: speak to me to me sic, and pardon my presumption."
1,I will protect the first the latter I commit to your charge.
1,"We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew's, and along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us."
1,I knew that it was possible that your suspicions might be excited; but I trusted that my simple word would cause them to disappear.
1,I alluded to the coldness of her letters; but the few minutes we had spent together sufficiently explained the origin of this.
1,"Sordid care, avaunt menial labours, and pains, slight in themselves, but too gigantic for our exhausted strength, shall make no part of our ephemeral existences."
1,"Raymond sprung lightly on his horse, grasped the standard, and with words which I could not hear but his gestures, being their fit accompaniment, were marked by passionate energy, he seemed to adjure their assistance and companionship; even as he spoke, the crowd receded from him."
1,"Fear overcame me; I dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble, although I was unable to define them."
1,"Her faultless nature, one sum of perfections, is wrapt up in her affections if they were hurt, she would droop like an unwatered floweret, and the slightest injury they receive is a nipping frost to her."
1,"How lovely is spring As we looked from Windsor Terrace on the sixteen fertile counties spread beneath, speckled by happy cottages and wealthier towns, all looked as in former years, heart cheering and fair."
1,"I was rough as the elements, and unlearned as the animals I tended."
1,"We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on."
1,"""Why do you answer me so roughly?"""
1,"We have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not expected."
1,"See you not the thunderbolt fall, and are deafened by the shout of heaven that follows its descent?"
1,"The natural clinging of the human mind to life and joy was in its full energy in her young heart; she gave herself impetuously up to the enchantment: they were married; and in their radiant features I saw incarnate, for the last time, the spirit of love, of rapturous sympathy, which once had been the life of the world."
1,"Besides, though the violence of her anguish made life hateful, it had not yet produced that monotonous, lethargic sense of changeless misery which for the most part produces suicide."
1,"One of his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty."
1,"Her father, though of high rank, had in the end dissipated his fortune, and even destroyed his reputation and influence through a course of dissolute indulgence."
1,"What slave will not, if he may, escape from his chains?"
1,"I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred."
1,"Sometimes she reproached herself for taking too bitterly to heart, that which many would esteem an imaginary evil; but this was no subject for reason; and, ignorant as she was of the motives and true conduct of Raymond, things assumed for her even a worse appearance, than the reality warranted."
1,"I was on deck, enjoying our swift progress."
1,"I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the daemon's disappointment."
1,"The devastation was not confined to the towns, but spread throughout the country; the hunter died in the woods, the peasant in the corn fields, and the fisher on his native waters."
1,"We had many pitched battles, during which no word was spoken, hardly a look was interchanged, but in which each resolved not to submit to the other."
1,"After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva."
1,"I had the newspaper in my hand, and, as usual, had turned to the intelligence from Greece."
1,Her society was my chief solace and delight; and my spirits always rose at the expectation of seeing her.
1,"He had carried off their store of winter food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the horror struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts."
1,"The autumn was warm and rainy: the infirm and sickly died off happier they: many young people flushed with health and prosperity, made pale by wasting malady, became the inhabitants of the grave."
1,"Her only consolation during the violence which she did herself, was to watch the motions of an illuminated clock, and internally count the moments which must elapse before she could be alone."
1,"Persecuted and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?"" ""Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than the strange chances that have lately occurred."
1,During my wanderings I never slept without first calling down gentle dreams on your head.
1,"The dead were carried out, and the sick brought in, with like indifference; some were screaming with pain, others laughing from the influence of more terrible delirium; some were attended by weeping, despairing relations, others called aloud with thrilling tenderness or reproach on the friends who had deserted them, while the nurses went from bed to bed, incarnate images of despair, neglect, and death."
1,"I shall not pause in my exertions until that time; but, if plague revives with the coming year, all contest with her must cease, and our only occupation be the choice of a grave."""
1,"We were all equal now; magnificent dwellings, luxurious carpets, and beds of down, were afforded to all."
1,None but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science.
1,She saw that he was endowed with genius and surpassing talent; these she cultivated for the sake of afterwards using them for the furtherance of her own views.
1,"I visited with my father every delightful spot, either on the islands, or by the side of the tree sheltered waterfalls; every shady path, or dingle entangled with underwood and fern."
1,I gave him love only.
1,"Now, I looked on the evening star, as softly and calmly it hung pendulous in the orange hues of sunset."
1,"Yet, even then, I have checked thick coming fears with one thought; I would not fear death, for the emotions that linked us must be immortal."
1,"My life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances."
1,"He made her warm offers of service; she was too much occupied by more engrossing thoughts, either to accept or reject them; at length he left her, making a promise to repeat his visit the next day."
1,"Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more I persuaded myself was yet behind."
1,"The glory of life was gone for her; the roseate halo of love, which had imbued every object with its own colour, faded; she was content to take life as it was, and to make the best of leaden coloured reality."
1,"Death snatches away many blooming children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture?"
1,"His stud of beautiful horses, his arms of costly workmanship, the praise that attended him, the adoration, ready servitor, high place and high esteem, I considered them as forcibly wrenched from me, and envied them all with novel and tormenting bitterness."
1,My thoughts were gems to enrich the treasure house of man's intellectual possessions; each sentiment was a precious gift I bestowed on them.
1,"You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself."
1,"""The repetition would be useless,"" said Raymond, ""since I well remember them, and have many others, self suggested, which speak with unanswerable persuasion."""
1,"He heard of the passing events of the day; he knew that, if he returned, and resumed his place in society, the entrance was still open, and it required but the will, to surround himself at once with the associations and habits of boyhood."
1,"Such a violet was sweet Perdita, trembling to entrust herself to the very air, cowering from observation, yet betrayed by her excellences; and repaying with a thousand graces the labour of those who sought her in her lonely bye path."
1,"With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet."
1,She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins.
1,I had no horses she wrung her hands.
1,"Let fancy pourtray the joyous scene of the twentieth of June, such as even now my aching heart recalls it."
1,"""Your repentance,"" I said, ""is now superfluous."
1,"You, who fancy that you can read the human soul, as your native lake reads each crevice and folding of its surrounding hills say what you think of me; king expectant, angel or devil, which?"""
1,"The silly moon and inconstant planets vary nightly their erratic dance; the sun itself, sovereign of the sky, ever and anon deserts his throne, and leaves his dominion to night and winter."
1,"""There he lies, white and cold in death."
1,"""Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger."
1,"In the south, the disease, virulent and immedicable, had nearly annihilated the race of man; storm and inundation, poisonous winds and blights, filled up the measure of suffering."
1,"There was an eager delight in our tones and gestures that could only spring from deep mutual love joined to the most unrestrained confidence; and now the next day, the next hour, I saw his brows contracted, his eyes fixed in sullen fierceness on the ground, and his voice so gentle and so dear made me shiver when he addressed me."
1,"But the weather was serene, and as I walked on I fell into no unpleasing reveries."
1,"But do you not see, that, under the idea of exalting me, he is chalking out a new path for himself; a path of action from which he has long wandered?"
1,But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland alone.
1,This had been the secret of his secession at the time of Lord Raymond's election.
1,"But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings."
1,"It was this that led me here: I thought that if I could again awaken in my heart the grief I had felt at the loss of your mother, and the many associations with her memory which had been laid to sleep for seventeen years, that all love for her child would become extinct."
1,"For a moment she thought that she could stem the torrent, and that Raymond could be induced to hear reason from her. Vain hope The moment of her influence was passed."
1,It is a scene terrifically desolate.
1,How refuse the offers of this generous friend?
1,"The young people, the Etonians, and children of the neighbouring gentry, held a mock fair, to which all the country people were invited."
1,"Your temper is made unequal by suffering, and the tenor of your mind is, I fear, sometimes shaken by unworthy causes; but let your confidence in my sympathy and love be deeper far, and incapable of being reached by these agitations that come and go, and if they touch not your affections leave you uninjured."""
1,"Nay, Henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe."
1,"Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were ineffectual."
1,"At length, in an abrupt manner she asked, ""Where is he?"" ""O, fear not,"" she continued, ""fear not that I should entertain hope Yet tell me, have you found him?"
1,"In all our transactions with him our honour must be inviolate, the integrity of our relations untainted: fate and circumstance may, when he arrives at maturity, separate us for ever but, as his aegis in danger, his consolation in hardship, let the ardent youth for ever bear with him through the rough path of life, love and honour for his parents."
1,"And then I thought again of his words ""I WILL BE WITH YOU ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT."""
1,"Raymond repeated his instructions, and the visitor retired."
1,"You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards this place I resolved to proceed."
1,"""As he approached his desire of seeing me,"" he said, ""became more and more ardent, and he felt that the moment when he should first clasp me in his arms would be the happiest of his life."""
1,"Raymond was only the more excited by this consideration to discover him; impelled by the interest he took in obscure talent, he therefore ordered a person skilled in such matters, to follow the Greek the next time he came, and observe the house in which he should enter."
1,"At night, when she could leave me unperceived, she wandered through the house, or hung over the couches of her children; and in the day time would sink into a perturbed sleep, while her murmurs and starts betrayed the unquiet dreams that vexed her."
1,"Good God Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety, your surprise would have been boundless."
1,"It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain."
1,"Her hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head."
1,"""You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations."
1,"Bankers, merchants, and manufacturers, whose trade depended on exports and interchange of wealth, became bankrupt."
1,"Again I rose, and exerting all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat."
1,"""And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life."""
1,"I often said to myself, my father is dead."
1,"He looked upon me, however, with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors, he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion."
1,"I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone."
1,"Perceiving the weakness of Raymond, I was afraid of ill consequences from the pressure of the crowd on his landing."
1,Love is a delicate sprite and easily hurt by rough jealousy.
1,"Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my joints more supple."
1,"Lonely musings, interminable wanderings, and solemn music were her only pastimes."
1,"My answer to these questions must needs appear to you unsatisfactory, yet they have sufficed to lead me on, day after day, enduring every wretchedness, rather than by such means to seek relief."
1,"For her children's sake alone she consented to remain, shorn of regality, a member of the English republic."
1,"Great God If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage."
1,"Lord Raymond was never born to be a drone in the hive, and to find content in our pastoral life."
1,"Shall I go alone, or will you accompany me?"""
1,This action of Adrian provoked me.
1,"I will put you in safety meanwhile, and return to you immediately."""
1,"My father felt that his fall was near; but so far from profiting by this last calm before the storm to save himself, he sought to forget anticipated evil by making still greater sacrifices to the deity of pleasure, deceitful and cruel arbiter of his destiny."
1,"Sometimes I endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his creature's formation, but on this point he was impenetrable."
1,"This I most earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply."""
1,Among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest.
1,"The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm."
1,We first came upon a few stragglers of the Irish at St. Albans.
1,"""Come,"" said Raymond, ""I yielded to you yesterday, now comply with my request take the pencil."""
1,"This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill suited to the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue."
1,And will a contented conscience compensate for fallen hopes a slandered name torn affections all the miseries of civilized life?
1,"I acted then, as I ever must, from impulse."
1,"""How is this?"" he cried."
1,"With new courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore."

1,"""Is that all, my dear Henry?"
1,"Adieu, my dear Margaret."
1,"Enter the house of mourning, my friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not with hatred for your enemies."
1,Her face was radiant with a smile.
1,"By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him wonderfully."
1,"Once for me, you relinquished the prospect of a crown."
1,"I confess that neither the structure of languages, nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me."
1,"I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel."
1,"His voice, usually gentle, often startled you by a sharp discordant note, which shewed that his usual low tone was rather the work of study than nature."
1,"The blue eyes of my angelic girl were fixed on this sweet emblem of herself: ""How the light palpitates,"" she said, ""which is that star's life."
1,"The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine was condemned."
1,"And although I could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M. Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town."
1,"I shall immediately depart for Dunkeld."""
1,"The dazzling light of ornamented rooms; lovely forms arrayed in splendid dresses; the motions of a dance, the voluptuous tones of exquisite music, cradled my senses in one delightful dream."
1,"You will find him at Dunkeld; gentle and tractable he wanders up the hills, and through the wood, or sits listening beside the waterfall."
1,"Suddenly he started up and fled from me; I pursued him: we sped over the fields, and by the skirts of woods, and on the banks of rivers; he flew fast and I followed."
1,It must be the excess of madness that could make me imagine that I could ever be aught but one alone; struck off from humanity; bearing no affinity to man or woman; a wretch on whom Nature had set her ban.
1,"The possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations."
1,"It gave ideality to that, from which, taken in naked truth, the soul would have revolted: it bestowed pictorial colours on misery and disease, and not unfrequently relieved me from despair in deplorable changes."
1,"The pictures drawn in these books were so vivid, that we seemed to have experienced the results depicted by them."
1,"We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix."
1,"If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched."
1,Perdita reproached us bitterly.
1,Yet how could I find this?
1,"""I am now going to undertake an office fitted for me."
1,"In answer to this question, I described our gloomy winter life, our sordid cares, our menial labours: ""This northern country,"" I said, ""is no place for our diminished race."
1,It were no mighty leap methinks from Calais to Dover.
1,"She told me, that she had kept up her strength and courage till her arrival at my cottage, and then both failed."
1,"He says all hope is dead to him, and I know that it is dead to me, so we are both equally fitted for death."
1,"""Dearest Clerval,"" exclaimed I, ""how kind, how very good you are to me."
1,"""Nay,"" said Perdita, ""that task shall be mine."
1,"Mingled with this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour."
1,"Love for you invested the world for me in enchanted light; it was no longer the earth I trod the earth, common mother, yielding only trite and stale repetition of objects and circumstances old and worn out."
1,"""Every minute,"" continued M. Krempe with warmth, ""every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost."
1,I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed.
1,"I had before visited the manor houses and gentlemen's seats, and often found the inhabitants actuated by the purest benevolence, ready to lend their utmost aid for the welfare of their tenants."
1,The position of the stars was my only guide.
1,"Her country, its ancient annals, its late memorable struggles, were all made to partake in her glory and excellence."
1,"After many struggles, she succeeded, and turned to join the company."
1,"He had seen it, and praised it; it was again retouched by her, each stroke of her pencil was as a chord of thrilling music, and bore to her the idea of a temple raised to celebrate the deepest and most unutterable emotions of her soul."
1,"I was on one of the highest seats, and saw him walk up the passage to the table of the speaker."
1,"Once, overcome by fatigue, I sunk on the wet earth; about two hundred yards distant, alone in a large meadow stood a magnificent oak; the lightnings shewed its myriad boughs torn by the storm."
1,"Her conversation was full of pointed remark and discernment; in her pleasant alcove, redolent with sweetest flowers, adorned by magnificent casts, antique vases, and copies of the finest pictures of Raphael, Correggio, and Claude, painted by herself, I fancied myself in a fairy retreat untainted by and inaccessible to the noisy contentions of politicians and the frivolous pursuits of fashion."
1,I thought foolish wretch that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people.
1,"He was like a poet of old whom the muses had crowned in his cradle, and on whose lips bees had fed."
1,"If you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have lived."""
1,"After this Martha was seated more firmly than ever on the regal seat, elevated by reverence and love."
1,"Again I am a solitary man; and I will become again, as in my early years, a wanderer, a soldier of fortune."
1,"Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room."
1,"But the main substance rests on the truths contained in these poetic rhapsodies, and the divine intuition which the Cumaean damsel obtained from heaven."
1,"To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self interest, are full of brotherly love and charity."
1,"I was led to London, and had to endure for some weeks cold looks, cold words and colder consolations: but I escaped; they tried to bind me with fetters that they thought silken, yet which weighed on me like iron, although I broke them more easily than a girth formed of a single straw and fled to freedom."
1,Circumstances had called me to London; here I heard talk that symptoms of the plague had occurred in hospitals of that city.
1,Idris was well content with this resolve of mine.
1,"""It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding place among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply to you."
1,The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours.
1,"What deep and sacred emotions are excited in a father's bosom, when he first becomes convinced that his love for his child is not a mere instinct, but worthily bestowed, and that others, less akin, participate his approbation It was supreme happiness to Idris and myself, to find that the frankness which Alfred's open brow indicated, the intelligence of his eyes, the tempered sensibility of his tones, were not delusions, but indications of talents and virtues, which would ""grow with his growth, and strengthen with his strength."""
1,In the mean time Raymond was eloquent.
1,"False was all this false all but the affections of our nature, and the links of sympathy with pleasure or pain."
1,"Tall, thin, and strait, her face still handsome, her raven hair hardly tinged with grey, her forehead arched and beautiful, had not the eye brows been somewhat scattered it was impossible not to be struck by her, almost to fear her."
1,I was silent: all was silent except the roaring of the sea which became louder and more dreadful.
1,"When he conversed with me his manner was cold and constrained; his eyes only seemed to speak, and as he turned their black, full lustre towards me they expressed a living sadness."
1,"Adrian, Idris and I, were established in Windsor Castle; Lord Raymond and my sister, inhabited a house which the former had built on the borders of the Great Park, near Perdita's cottage, as was still named the low roofed abode, where we two, poor even in hope, had each received the assurance of our felicity."
1,"At length his eyes unclosed faintly, yet with a look of returning life; he became pale and weak; but the rigidity of his features was softened by approaching convalescence."
1,"When they found themselves discovered they discharged their muskets, and some came to the front to cover the others, whose crews, exerting all their strength, endeavoured to escape with their light barks from among the dark hulls that environed them."
1,"You dare not keep me.' ""'Frankenstein you belong then to my enemy to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.'"
1,In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it.
1,"My convalescence rapidly advanced, yet this was the thought that haunted me, and I was for ever forming plans how I might hereafter contrive to escape the tortures that were prepared for me when I should mix in society, and to find that solitude which alone could suit one whom an untold grief seperated from her fellow creatures."
1,The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger.
1,"He was one of those very few whom fortune favours from their birth; on whom she bestows all gifts of intellect and person with a profusion that knew no bounds, and whom under her peculiar protection, no imperfection however slight, or disappointment however transitory has leave to touch."
1,"""I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books."
1,"You will find a happy, cheerful home and friends who love you dearly."
1,"Chance or rather the evil influence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's door led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy."
1,"Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice."
1,"Perdita at length subdued her burst of passion, and rose, she looked round for Clara; the child frightened, not recognizing her father, and neglected by us, had crept to the other end of the boat; she came at her mother's call."
1,"My productions however were sufficiently unpretending; they were confined to the biography of favourite historical characters, especially those whom I believed to have been traduced, or about whom clung obscurity and doubt."
1,"I have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge."
1,Alfred's serious air shewed that he still revolved the tragic story related by the Italian boy.
1,"She slept; and quiet prevailed in the Castle, whose inhabitants were hushed to repose."
1,"If she is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality."""
1,"They seemed full of careful thought, and a few words of their conversation that reached me, induced me to approach and make further enquiries."
1,"I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer."
1,"A wind swept across the plain, I looked around me and saw no object that told me where I was; I had lost myself, and in vain attempted to find my path."
1,"I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus."
1,"I have a friend who loves me as his life, and in whose breast I should infix a mortal sting if I ungratefully left him."
1,"Take the Protectorship who will; before God I renounce it"" ""And before God,"" replied his opponent, fervently, ""do I receive it No one will canvass for this honour now none envy my danger or labours."
1,"As grief might change Constance so would deceit change me untill in heaven you would say, ""This is not my child"" My father, to be happy both now and when again we meet I must fly from all this life which is mockery to one like me."
1,"Posterity is no more; fame, and ambition, and love, are words void of meaning; even as the cattle that grazes in the field, do thou, O deserted one, lie down at evening tide, unknowing of the past, careless of the future, for from such fond ignorance alone canst thou hope for ease Joy paints with its own colours every act and thought."
1,"I watched him, but could make but little of him."
1,"I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing."
1,"A moment more and Perdita appeared; she stood before me in the fresh bloom of youthful womanhood, different from and yet the same as the mountain girl I had left."
1,I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.
1,These were dreadful fears and they even haunted my dreams.
1,"Well, this could not last."
1,"They swept the country like a conquering army, burning laying waste murdering."
1,"I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him."
1,"But all at close of day, with riven planks and rent canvas make for shore, and are either wrecked ere they reach it, or find some wave beaten haven, some desart strand, whereon to cast themselves and die unmourned."
1,"If she died, where could there be found on record a murderer, whose cruel act might compare with his?"
1,"The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain."
1,At that instant my father entered.
1,"Every man for himself the devil take the protectorship, say I, if it expose me to danger"" ""Faint hearted man"" cried Adrian indignantly ""Your countrymen put their trust in you, and you betray them"" ""I betray them"" said Ryland, ""the plague betrays me."
1,"Even the poor deer, our antlered proteges, were obliged to fall for the sake of worthier pensioners."
1,"He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery."
1,"I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived the idea of returning if set free."
1,"Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture."
1,"""Shall each man,"" cried he, ""find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone?"
1,He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives.
1,"With these, her children, the noble widow constantly resided at Windsor; and admitted no visitors, except her own partizans, travellers from her native Germany, and a few of the foreign ministers."
1,What then became of me?
1,"The first subject that occupied the attention of the house was an address from the Lord Protector, praying them to appoint a deputy during a necessary absence on his part."
1,"His feelings are forever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties."
1,"This aroused the stranger's attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had pursued."
1,"Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge."
1,"I adjure you, my father, has not an unnatural passion seized upon your heart?"
1,"""As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection."
1,"Each day was eagerly counted; and the inhabitants of towns, desirous to leap this dangerous interval, plunged into dissipation, and strove, by riot, and what they wished to imagine to be pleasure, to banish thought and opiate despair."
1,"Gradually the object of fear sank beneath the horizon, and to the last shot up shadowy beams into the otherwise radiant air."
1,During this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.
1,"We hired a chaise here, and with four horses drove with speed through the storm."
1,"She only felt in his embrace a dear assurance that while he possessed her, he would not despair."
1,"He repined for the loss of what was more necessary to him than air or food the excitements of pleasure, the admiration of the noble, the luxurious and polished living of the great."
1,"And again she heard, ""She will not wake till late to morrow, and we shall then be at sea."" ""All is ready,"" at length the woman announced."
1,"We are not formed for enjoyment; and, however we may be attuned to the reception of pleasureable emotion, disappointment is the never failing pilot of our life's bark, and ruthlessly carries us on to the shoals."
1,"Clara was greatly moved; with streaming eyes, suppressing her sobs, she leaned from the window, watching the last glimpse of her native Windsor."
1,"It drinks the dark blood of the inhabitant of the south, but it never feasts on the pale faced Celt."
1,"The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious presence chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands."
1,"""Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us."
1,"While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me."
1,There does not exist the man in England with adequate presumption.
1,"The men filled the mosques; the women, veiled, hastened to the tombs, and carried offerings to the dead, thus to preserve the living."
1,One star only trembled in the depth of the kindling atmosphere.
1,We remained for the night at Luton.
1,"For the merits of my adaptation and translation must decide how far I have well bestowed my time and imperfect powers, in giving form and substance to the frail and attenuated Leaves of the Sibyl."
1,"He wrote to the address given, desiring to see the draughtsman, that such alterations might be made, as should be suggested in a consultation between him and the original conceiver."
1,Idris had disappeared.
1,"Adrian remained in the coffee room, while I, in compliance with his desire, took my seat in St. Stephen's."
1,"He seemed insensible to the presence of any one else, but if, as a trial to awaken his sensibility, my aunt brought me into the room he would instantly rush out with every symptom of fury and distraction."
1,Our Castle became an asylum for the unhappy.
1,My heart was bleeding from its death's wound; I could live no otherwise Often amid apparent calm I was visited by despair and melancholy; gloom that nought could dissipate or overcome; a hatred of life; a carelessness of beauty; all these would by fits hold me nearly annihilated by their powers.
1,"He plucks flowers and weeds, and weaves chaplets of them, or sails yellow leaves and bits of bark on the stream, rejoicing in their safety, or weeping at their wreck."
1,"It may be advanced for a truth, that, if argument or entreaty can turn any one from a desperate purpose, whose motive and end depends on the strength of the affections only, then it is right so to turn them, since their docility shews, that neither the motive nor the end were of sufficient force to bear them through the obstacles attendant on their undertaking."
1,The selected passion of the soul of Raymond was ambition.
1,"Lay down your arms, fellow men brethren Pardon, succour, and brotherly love await your repentance."
1,"Raymond, being somewhat recovered, prepared to re assume his command in the army."
1,They penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding places.
1,"He tore from reality the mask with which she had been clothed; and the purposes of Raymond, which before had crept around, ensnaring by stealth, now stood a hunted stag even at bay as all perceived who watched the irrepressible changes of his countenance."
1,It came as some gentle visitation; it went and I hardly felt the loss.
1,"The few jewels they had saved, supported them awhile."
1,I have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet.
1,Perdita was still to a great degree uneducated.
1,Adrian led the troops.
1,"To leave the country of our fathers, made holy by their graves We could not feel even as a voluntary exile of old, who might for pleasure or convenience forsake his native soil; though thousands of miles might divide him, England was still a part of him, as he of her."
1,"He is so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command."
1,"I reflected on this, and by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire."
1,"Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by horror and despair."
1,The hours were slow for each minute was employed; we lived more in one week than many do in the course of several months and the variety and novelty of our pleasures gave zest to each.
1,"I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and afterwards their love."
1,"These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye."
1,It was difficult to find an immediate remedy.
1,"Chapter Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear."
1,"She had been moved from the posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have supposed her asleep."
1,"Neither yours nor any man's death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own."
1,"Sometimes, when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me."
1,"In the sunny clime of Persia, in the crowded cities of China, amidst the aromatic groves of Cashmere, and along the southern shores of the Mediterranean, such scenes had place."
1,"As night came on, her spirits, enlivened by my unexpected concession, regained an almost forgotten vivacity."
1,"But life was yet strong within me; I recovered: nor did it a little aid my returning health that my recollections were at first vague, and that I was too weak to feel any violent emotion."
1,"Yet, to the honour of the English be it recorded, that, although natural disinclination made them delay awhile, yet when the misery of their fellow creatures became glaring, an enthusiastic generosity inspired their decrees."
1,"Sheath your weapons; these are your brothers, commit not fratricide; soon the plague will not leave one for you to glut your revenge upon: will you be more pitiless than pestilence?"
1,"The next evening therefore, though the autumnal change had brought on cold and rain, Adrian and Idris entered my cottage."
1,He had traced the man to one of the most penurious streets in the metropolis.
1,"Several hundreds landed in Ireland, about the first of November, and took possession of such vacant habitations as they could find; seizing upon the superabundant food, and the stray cattle."
1,My words flowed spontaneously my utterance was firm and quick.
1,Adrian leaned against the wall.
1,"At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence."
1,"""Alas Alas What am I become?"
1,"He foresaw that his own life would be one of struggle, and I must partake his labours with him."
1,"I have already put off the carelessness of childhood, the unlined brow, and springy gait of early years, that they may adorn thee."
1,"Tell me, however, in what way he passes his time; what he is doing and thinking in his cottage retreat?"" ""Nay, my sweet sister,"" replied Adrian, ""you ask me more than I can well answer; but if you feel interest in him, why not visit him?"
1,"That Raymond should marry Idris was more than ever intolerable; yet my passion, though a giant from its birth, was too strange, wild, and impracticable, for me to feel at once the misery I perceived in Perdita."
1,"""You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes."
1,In these last moments I feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.
1,I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.
1,"While I was thus engaged, Ernest entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me: ""Welcome, my dearest Victor,"" said he. ""Ah I wish you had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted."
1,"A number of people from North America, the relics of that populous continent, had set sail for the East with mad desire of change, leaving their native plains for lands not less afflicted than their own."
1,Alas I must for ever conceal the wretchedness that consumes me.
1,All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable.
1,You doubtless recollect these papers.
1,"I, the offspring of love, the child of the woods, the nursling of Nature's bright self was to submit to this?"
1,"That Idris, the princely born, nursling of wealth and luxury, should have come through the tempestuous winter night from her regal abode, and standing at my lowly door, conjure me to fly with her through darkness and storm was surely a dream again her plaintive tones, the sight of her loveliness assured me that it was no vision."
1,"We were in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed."
1,The presence of a friend in its armies and councils made us enter into the details with enthusiasm; and a short letter now and then from Raymond told us how he was engrossed by the interests of his adopted country.
1,"Death, cruel and relentless, had entered these beloved walls."
1,"That he need not plunge into this destructive dissipation for the sake of disgusting me, and causing me to fly."
1,"But now my mother, or, if you will, my mother's lessons, awaken within me."
1,"Not far from my cottage was a small cluster of pines the only trees to be seen for many miles: I had a path cut through the furze from my door to this little wood, from whose topmost branches the birds saluted the rising sun and awoke me to my daily meditation."
1,"""Nor are outward objects alone the receptacles of the Spirit of Good."
1,And was I really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?
1,And then swiftly he dispatched his aides de camp to command the horse to fall on the routed enemy.
1,"Look not on the star, dear love, or do, and let that eternal spark plead for me; let it be my witness and my advocate, silent as it shines love is to me as light to the star; even so long as that is uneclipsed by annihilation, so long shall I love you."""
1,"She had rejected these advances; and the time for such exuberant submission, which must be founded on love and nourished by it, was now passed."
1,The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.
1,"I, who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasure I was now alone."
1,"This enemy to the human race had begun early in June to raise its serpent head on the shores of the Nile; parts of Asia, not usually subject to this evil, were infected."
1,I must arise and examine.
1,"Why talk of infancy, manhood, and old age?"
1,"""Indeed it does, Lionel,"" she replied; ""I quite long to see him; he is the descendant of our kings, the first noble of the land: every one admires and loves him, and they say that his rank is his least merit; he is generous, brave, and affable."""
1,"His foreign birth, and he refused to throw off his allegiance to his native country, alone prevented him from filling the first offices in the state."
1,"It was through her beloved lessons that he cast off his old pursuits and gradually formed himself to become one among his fellow men; a distinguished member of society, a Patriot; and an enlightened lover of truth and virtue."
1,"Not so Idris; her first glance was for her brother; she took his hand, she kissed his eye lids, and hung over him with looks of compassion and love."
1,A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity.
1,"When I left them they had tormented me but it was in the same way as pain and sickness may torment; somthing extraneous to the mind that galled it, and that I wished to cast aside."
1,"In days of happiness I have often repeated to myself, with a grateful heart and exulting spirit, all that Raymond sacrificed for me."
1,"My dear Lionel, we are married men, and find employment sufficient in amusing our wives, and dancing our children."
1,In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me.
1,"She sat upon the ground absorbed in wordless despair, when through the gusty wind and bickering rain she thought she heard her name called."
1,"Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel."
1,This idea was torture to him.
1,"The morning air blowing freshly over the dewy plants, rushed into the heated room."
1,"The Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils."
1,"Covering the earth with their creations and forming by the power of their minds another world more lovely than the visible frame of things, even all the world that we find in their writings."
1,"""And this pleases you?"""
1,"I, who have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes."
1,He compared the royal and republican spirit; shewed how the one tended to enslave the minds of men; while all the institutions of the other served to raise even the meanest among us to something great and good.
1,We had entered the Castle.
1,"I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success."
1,"Separated from them; exalted in my heart; sole possessor of my affections; single object of my hopes, the best half of myself."
1,In the morning I went to the court; my lips and throat were parched.
1,"The young are seldom in Elysium, for their desires, outstripping possibility, leave them as poor as a moneyless debtor."
1,"At about midnight Raymond and I took leave of my sister, to return to town."
1,"When they spoke of his probable death and certain captivity, tears streamed from their eyes; even as the women of Syria sorrowed for Adonis, did the wives and mothers of Greece lament our English Raymond Athens was a city of mourning."
1,"The events that in succession followed his return to England, gave me keener feelings."
1,"""They built a wall between them and the world"" Without, a thousand harpies raved, remorse and misery, expecting the destined moment for their invasion."
1,"We had for many years trod the highway of life hand in hand, and still thus linked, we might step within the shades of death; but her children, her lovely, playful, animated children beings sprung from her own dear side portions of her own being depositories of our loves even if we died, it would be comfort to know that they ran man's accustomed course."
1,"My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man."
1,"From her I should learn the truth concerning our protector; I should hear why she had withdrawn from the protection of the Princess Evadne, and be instructed as to the influence which this overtopping and towering Raymond exercised over the fortunes of my friend."
1,Henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education.
1,"Thus in her twenty ninth year she died; having enjoyed some few years of the happiness of paradise, and sustaining a reverse to which her impatient spirit and affectionate disposition were unable to submit."
1,The saintly soul of Elizabeth shone like a shrine dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
1,"She never complained, but sleep and appetite fled from her, a slow fever preyed on her veins, her colour was hectic, and she often wept in secret; gloomy prognostications, care, and agonizing dread, ate up the principle of life within her."
1,"But that country had so many resources in the way of agriculture, that the rush of population from one part of it to another, and its increase through foreign emigration, was less felt than with us."
1,"Aye, I might die my soul with falsehood untill I had quite hid its native colour."
1,"Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate."
1,"Where can any of us go?"""
1,"He was first struck by the space of time that had elapsed, since madness, rather than any reasonable impulse, had regulated his actions."
1,"If a feeling of dissatisfaction ever crossed her, it arose from the idea that he was not perfectly happy."
1,"I gave the right place to every personage in the groupe, the just balance to every sentiment."
1,"I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me."
1,"I will not be put off thus: do you think that I can live thus fearfully from day to day the sword in my bosom yet kept from its mortal wound by a hair a word I demand that dreadful word; though it be as a flash of lightning to destroy me, speak it."
1,All outward things seemed to have lost their existence relatively to him and only one circumstance could in any degree recall him from his motionless and mute despair: he would never see me.
1,"I have spent days and nights of festivity; I have joined in ambitious hopes, and exulted in victory: now, shut the door on the world, and build high the wall that is to separate me from the troubled scene enacted within its precincts."
1,I had several times seen him ride across the heath and felt angry that my solitude should be disturbed.
1,"In his amendment he proposed, that an exception should be made in the bill in favour of any person who claimed the sovereign power in right of the earls of Windsor."
1,"A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole human race."""
1,"I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings."
1,I could be found in no state of mind which I would not willingly have exchanged for nothingness.
1,"I lifted her into the chaise; I assured her that with our four horses we should arrive in London before five o'clock, the hour when she would be sought and missed."
1,"I said to myself, let him receive sympathy and these struggles will cease."
1,One by one they left her at length she pressed the hand of her last visitor.
1,"""After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey."
1,"From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty."
1,The events that immediately followed on my arrival at Windsor changed this view of things.
1,Then again the kindly influence ceased to act I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection.
1,"""Indeed I dare not die."
1,I am well acquainted with the accused.
1,"The very beauty of the Grecian climate, during the season of spring, added torture to her sensations."
1,"I clasped that kind hand; I tried to answer; a fervent ""God bless you"" was all my ignorance could frame of speech, and I darted away, oppressed by my new emotions."
1,I drew a touching picture of his vacillating health; I boasted of my own strength.
1,"I replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole."
1,Everything favoured my journey.
1,"On the th of December of that year, my companion and I crossed the Bay, to visit the antiquities which are scattered on the shores of Baiae."
1,I rambled amidst the wild scenery of this lovely country and became a complete mountaineer: I passed hours on the steep brow of a mountain that overhung a waterfall or rowed myself in a little skiff to some one of the islands.
1,Let us lament over and assist the children of the garden of the earth.
1,"I confess to you, my friend, that I love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion."
1,I was as a solitary spot among mountains shut in on all sides by steep black precipices; where no ray of heat could penetrate; and from which there was no outlet to sunnier fields.
1,"He might with equal interest to us, have added a commentary, to describe the unknown and unimaginable lineaments of the creatures, who would then occupy the vacated dwelling of mankind."
1,"Such incursions struck the English with affright, in all those towns where there was still sufficient population to feel the change."
1,When we were in company he affected gaiety but I wept to hear his hollow laugh begun by an empty smile and often ending in a bitter sneer such as never before this fatal period had wrinkled his lips.
1,"""Did we form ourselves, choosing our dispositions, and our powers?"
1,"""The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer."
1,"""The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth."
1,"The passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight."
1,"She thought of the treasure she possessed in the affections of her lord; of his accomplishments, surpassing those of his contemporaries, his genius, his devotion to her."
1,The next morning while sitting on the steps of the temple of Aesculapius in the Borghese gardens Fantasia again visited me smilingly beckoned to me to follow her My flight was at first heavy but the breezes commanded by the spirit to convoy me grew stronger as I advanced a pleasing languour seized my senses when I recovered I found my self by the Elysian fountain near Diotima The beautiful female whom I had left on the point of narrating her earthly history seemed to have waited for my return and as soon as I appeared she spoke thus I VISITED Naples in the year .
1,I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.
1,"Much as they were attached to each other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me."
1,She never for a moment credited the story of his death; she resolved instantly to go to Greece.
1,Diotima approached the fountain seated herself on a mossy mound near it and her disciples placed themselves on the grass near her Without noticing me who sat close under her she continued her discourse addressing as it happened one or other of her listeners but before I attempt to repeat her words I will describe the chief of these whom she appeared to wish principally to impress One was a woman of about years of age in the full enjoyment of the most exquisite beauty her golden hair floated in ringlets on her shoulders her hazle eyes were shaded by heavy lids and her mouth the lips apart seemed to breathe sensibility But she appeared thoughtful unhappy her cheek was pale she seemed as if accustomed to suffer and as if the lessons she now heard were the only words of wisdom to which she had ever listened The youth beside her had a far different aspect his form was emaciated nearly to a shadow his features were handsome but thin worn his eyes glistened as if animating the visage of decay his forehead was expansive but there was a doubt perplexity in his looks that seemed to say that
1,"""And we shall of course enjoy the benefit of the change,"" said Ryland, contemptuously."
1,"I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them."
1,"I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history."
1,"To these pangs were added the loss of Perdita, lost through my own accursed self will and conceit."
1,"The wretched female, loveless victim of vulgar brutality, had wandered to the toilet of high born beauty, and, arraying herself in the garb of splendour, had died before the mirror which reflected to herself alone her altered appearance."
1,"If he were truly my friend he would have calculated all this; and let me now calculate this boasted friendship, and discover its real worth."
1,Nor did Adrian instruct me only in the cold truths of history and philosophy.
1,At first he refused to stay to hear her.
1,"In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and irksome to me."
1,"In the unsteady glance of his eye, in his extreme desire to learn the opinions of all, in the feebleness of his hand writing, these qualities might be obscurely traced, but they were not generally known."
1,"""Do not think that I would intrude upon your confidence: I only ask your patience."
1,Tears streamed from my eyes.
1,"I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my recollection."
1,"But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth."
1,"""Have you, then, some other attachment?"" ""None on earth."
1,The poor wretch had lost his young wife and lovely infant by the plague.
1,"I dared, I conquered them all, till now I have sold myself to death, with the sole condition that thou shouldst follow me Fire, and war, and plague, unite for thy destruction O my Raymond, there is no safety for thee"" With an heavy heart I listened to the changes of her delirium; I made her a bed of cloaks; her violence decreased and a clammy dew stood on her brow as the paleness of death succeeded to the crimson of fever, I placed her on the cloaks."
1,"Sorrow doubles the burthen to the bent down back; plants thorns in the unyielding pillow; mingles gall with water; adds saltness to their bitter bread; cloathing them in rags, and strewing ashes on their bare heads."
1,"Unable to support the slow withering of her hopes, she suddenly formed a plan, resolving to terminate at once the period of misery, and to bring to an happy conclusion the late disastrous events."
1,"""You need not wonder that I freely discover Adrian's abode."
1,"What a brimful cup of joyful agony it was, when his face first gleamed with the glance of recognition when he pressed my hand, now more fevered than his own, and when he pronounced my name No trace of his past insanity remained, to dash my joy with sorrow."
1,"Remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again."
1,The arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.
1,"I do not weep or sigh; but I must reason with myself, and force myself to feel sorrow and despair."
1,"During the first stage of the election, the Duke of had been thrown out; the question therefore lay between Lord Raymond and Mr. Ryland."
1,A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England.
1,"Write, dearest Victor, one line one word will be a blessing to us."
1,"""This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to that."
1,Did you not call this a glorious expedition?
1,I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch I had created.
1,"What can I say? if you refuse to aid me, I am lost indeed"" She cast up her eyes, while wonder held her auditors mute; then, as if carried away by her feelings, she cried ""My brother beloved, ill fated Adrian how speak of your misfortunes?"
1,"In the mean time we were joined by Clara, whose pallid cheek and scared look shewed the deep impression grief had made on her young mind."
1,I must be more brief for night draws on apace and all my hours in this house are counted.
1,"I listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor, without letting escape inexperience in life would have made me ashamed any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours."
1,I listened to Raymond with intense interest.
1,"She had to do this, while in deep woe she sighed for loneliness, and would gladly have exchanged her crowded rooms for dark forest depths, or a drear, night enshadowed heath."
1,"Let us not for a moment forget our object and our hope; and they will form a resistless mound to stop the overflowing of our regret for trifles."""
1,"At length these obnoxious visits suddenly ceased altogether, but from that moment I must date the change of my father: a change that to remember makes me shudder and then filled me with the deepest grief."
1,She seemed to consider that through me she had lost Raymond; I was the evil influence of her life; I was even accused of encreasing and confirming the mad and base apostacy of Adrian from all views of advancement and grandeur; and now this miserable mountaineer was to steal her daughter.
1,"""We do also, unfortunately,"" replied my father, ""for indeed I had rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly."""
1,The nobles did not hesitate to express their fear; the other party endeavoured to treat the matter lightly.
1,"He gave me an illustrious name and noble station; the world's respect reflected from his own glory: all this joined to his own undying love, inspired me with sensations towards him, akin to those with which we regard the Giver of life."
1,"To this state there was no hope, no alleviation, unless the grave should quickly receive its destined prey, and she be permitted to die, before she experienced a thousand living deaths in the loss of those she loved."
1,"Flowers, the children of the spring, adorned her garden and casements; in the midst of lowliness there was an air of elegance which spoke the graceful taste of the inmate."
1,"My garments were torn, and they, as well as my hands, were stained with the blood of the man I had wounded; one hand grasped the dead birds my hard earned prey, the other held the knife; my hair was matted; my face besmeared with the same guilty signs that bore witness against me on the dripping instrument I clenched; my whole appearance was haggard and squalid."
1,"Alas, how great was the contrast between us He was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day."
1,"Could we domesticate a cub of this wild beast, and not fear its growth and maturity?"
1,"The younger part gathered round me to ask my advice; and those who had friends in London were anxious beyond the rest, to ascertain the present extent of disease in the metropolis."
1,Raymond questioned him; but his reserved answers soon made him turn from the man to the drawing.
1,"I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind."
1,"Even the source of colonies was dried up, for in New Holland, Van Diemen's Land, and the Cape of Good Hope, plague raged."
1,By a strange narrowness of ideas he viewed all the world in connexion only as it was or was not related to his little society.
1,As yet western Europe was uninfected; would it always be so?
1,"""Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court."
1,I have loved thee; and in my days both of happiness and sorrow I have peopled your solitudes with wild fancies of my own creation.
1,"She might have heard of my return from London, and my visit to Bolter's Lock, which, connected with my continued absence, might tend greatly to alarm her."
1,Who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude?
1,"Away with those blood stained arms, and hasten some of you to bind up these wounds."""
1,Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows.
1,"I am convinced, that had the myriad troops of Asia come from over the Propontis, and stood defenders of the Golden City, each and every Greek would have marched against the overwhelming numbers, and have devoted himself with patriotic fury for his country."
1,"The theatres were kept open; every place of public resort was frequented; though he endeavoured so to modify them, as might best quiet the agitation of the spectators, and at the same time prevent a reaction of misery when the excitement was over."
1,"I felt as the sailor, who from the topmast first discovered the shore of America; and like him I hastened to tell my companions of my discoveries in unknown regions."
1,"The winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected."
1,Alas To me the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and dismay.
1,"Timidity, which in her had almost amounted to awkwardness, was exchanged for a graceful decision of manner; frankness, instead of reserve, characterized her physiognomy; and her voice was attuned to thrilling softness."
1,"Unwonted silence reigned in the house, the members spoke in whispers, and the ordinary business was transacted with celerity and quietness."
1,This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described.
1,"Poor fellow he lay stretched on a bed of sickness, his cheeks glowing with the hues of fever, his eyes half closed, his breath irregular and difficult."
1,The rooks cawed loudly in the trees above; mixed with their hoarse cries I heard a lively strain of music.
1,"Alexander was a king; Solomon, the wisest of men, was a king; Napoleon was a king; Caesar died in his attempt to become one, and Cromwell, the puritan and king killer, aspired to regality."
1,"Methought I had been invited to Timon's last feast; I came with keen appetite, the covers were removed, the hot water sent up its unsatisfying steams, while I fled before the anger of the host, who assumed the form of Raymond; while to my diseased fancy, the vessels hurled by him after me, were surcharged with fetid vapour, and my friend's shape, altered by a thousand distortions, expanded into a gigantic phantom, bearing on its brow the sign of pestilence."
1,"But I can be the first to support and guard my country, now that terrific disasters and ruin have laid strong hands upon her."
1,Social feeling and sympathy constituted a marked feature in my disposition.
1,"If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more."
1,"There, Margaret, the sun is forever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour."
1,"I am going to unexplored regions, to ""the land of mist and snow,"" but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and woeful as the ""Ancient Mariner."""
1,"The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty."
1,"Take care of her and cherish her: one day I may claim her at your hands; but futurity is dark, make the present happy to her."" My father remained three months at Hamburgh; when he quitted it he changed his name, my aunt could never discover that which he adopted and only by faint hints, could conjecture that he had taken the road of Germany and Hungary to Turkey."
1,"They still appeared in public together, and lived under the same roof."
1,"They opened each other's letters, even as, until now, the inmost fold of the heart of each was disclosed to the other."
1,"Raymond had lost much of his popularity, and was deserted by his peculiar partizans."
1,"He owned affinity not only with mankind, but all nature was akin to him; the mountains and sky were his friends; the winds of heaven and the offspring of earth his playmates; while he the focus only of this mighty mirror, felt his life mingle with the universe of existence."
1,"""Mad and foolish boy"" exclaimed the angry lady, ""you have chosen with dreams and theories to overthrow my schemes for your own aggrandizement; but you shall not do the same by those I have formed for your sister."
1,"Men made perilous journies to possess themselves of earth's splendid trifles, gems and gold."
1,"If there is a chasm our mutual love will give us wings to pass it, and we shall find flowers, and verdure, and delight on the other side."""
1,Their intercourse continued.
1,"who loved him, as he did her; notwithstanding that disappointment quelled her passion, and ambition held strong combat with his."
1,How could I save them?
1,"Here I may even cease to repine, and may add my tardy consent to the decree which has taken him from me."
1,"A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth's simple and powerful appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude."
1,I love you very tenderly.
1,"""The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends."
1,"They ascend into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of the air we breathe."
1,"Perhaps a history such as mine had better die with me, but a feeling that I cannot define leads me on and I am too weak both in body and mind to resist the slightest impulse."
1,"""That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become the most miserable of mortals."
1,"Yet he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition."
1,"This feeling of universal misery assumed concentration and shape, when I looked on my wife and children; and the thought of danger to them possessed my whole being with fear."
1,"He snatched his hand from me, and rose in violent disorder: ""What do you mean?"
1,"If some scene of tremendous agony shook my frame and fevered my brow, I would lay my head on the lap of Idris, and the tumultuous pulses subsided into a temperate flow her smile could raise me from hopelessness, her embrace bathe my sorrowing heart in calm peace."
1,I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.
1,"""Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica she looked so frank hearted and happy."
1,"If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass before you and I may meet."
1,"""I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside."
1,"Now that unchanged serenity, and gentle compliance were added to her other qualifications, his respect equalled his love."
1,"No, we will have a Protector of our own."
1,She was half mad from the effects of uncontrollable agitation.
1,"""I fear that I speak in a constrained manner: my heart is overflowing with the ardent desire I have of bringing calm once more to your thoughts and looks; but I fear to aggravate your grief, or to raise that in you which is death to me, anger and distaste."
1,It did not require the measured sounds of human language to syllable the story of my extasy.
1,"Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder."""
1,"The uprising of the star of day was hailed by triumphant strains, while the birds, heard by snatches, filled up the intervals of the music."
1,"We forgot that Malcolm and Macduff were mere human beings, acted upon by such simple passions as warmed our own breasts."
1,"If manly courage and resistance can save us, we will be saved."
1,"That it would vanish altogether was an hope too dear too heartfelt, to be expressed."
1,"I see the desolate plain covered with white, save a few black patches that the noonday sun has made at the top of those sharp pointed hillocks from which the snow, sliding as it fell, lay thinner than on the plain ground: a few birds are pecking at the hard ice that covers the pools for the frost has been of long continuance."
1,"You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for despair."
1,"Oh the brave power of the bitter north wind which freezes the tears it has caused to shed But I will not bear this; go: the sun will rise and set as before you came, and I shall sit among the pines or wander on the heath weeping and complaining without wishing for you to listen."
1,He looked on the structure of society as but a part of the machinery which supported the web on which his life was traced.
1,"The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court."
1,Henry Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.
1,"All cold, and stiff, and dead Alas I am quite callous: the night I was out in was fearful and the cold rain that fell about my heart has acted like the waters of the cavern of Antiparos and has changed it to stone."
1,"My uncle will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I shall need no other happiness."
1,"The details contained in the foregoing pages, apparently trivial, yet each slightest one weighing like lead in the depressed scale of human afflictions; this tedious dwelling on the sorrows of others, while my own were only in apprehension; this slowly laying bare of my soul's wounds: this journal of death; this long drawn and tortuous path, leading to the ocean of countless tears, awakens me again to keen grief."
1,"For a time, I thought that, by watching a complying moment, fostering the still warm ashes, I might relume in her the flame of love."
1,In no one moment of coming time did I feel as I had done in time gone by.
1,"When we arrived at Rodosto, we found that the field had been taken, and the scheme of the battle arranged."
1,Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed.
1,"The nearness of this place to London was such, as to take away the idea of painful separation, when we quitted Raymond and Perdita."
1,I looked on the regal towers of Windsor.
1,So I was entirely thrown upon my own resourses.
1,This attack was directed against Raymond and his machinations for the restoration of the monarchy.
1,All these shews of despair struck Perdita with affright.
1,"My first visit would be to my sister, who inhabited a little cottage, a part of Adrian's gift, on the borders of Windsor Forest."
1,"I must not permit you to be acquainted with the extent of my delusion, lest you despise me; although, believe me, a wish to appear before you, not vanquished, but as a conqueror, inspired me during my wordy war."""
1,"I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion."
1,"I would obtain the truth from her the following day in the mean time But, while I was occupied by multiplying reflections, Lord Raymond returned."
1,"I had commenced my search late in the day, a November day, that closed in early with pattering rain and melancholy wind."
1,"We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast; but I was unable to contain myself."
1,We sat like one family round my hearth.
1,"Do you think that I will be questioned, and my replies disdainfully set aside? Do you think that I will be suspected, perhaps watched, cross questioned, and disbelieved?"
1,"Such were the strange and incredible events, that finally brought about my union with the sister of my best friend, with my adored Idris."
1,I must do justice to my sweet sister: it was not for herself that she was thus agonized.
1,"The tramp of horses, distinctly heard in the silence, was at length discerned."
1,"But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin."
1,My mother's tender caresses and my father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections.
1,His course was speedily decided upon.
1,"""The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced."
1,This is no sudden fancy; I live by it.
1,"After some observations on the scenery and seats, Raymond said: ""Philosophers have called man a microcosm of nature, and find a reflection in the internal mind for all this machinery visibly at work around us."
1,It is as the wood of the Eumenides none but the dying may enter; and Oedipus is about to die.
1,This indeed was the plague.
1,I loved you as a human father might be supposed to love a daughter borne to him by a heavenly mother; as Anchises might have regarded the child of Venus if the sex had been changed; love mingled with respect and adoration.
1,"He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs."
1,War was at last tacitly acknowledged between us.
1,"While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up."
1,"The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition, Justine was apprehended."
1,"There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents."
1,"The unexampled loveliness of the flower clad earth the genial sunshine and grateful shade the melody of the birds the majesty of the woods the splendour of the marble ruins the clear effulgence of the stars by night the combination of all that was exciting and voluptuous in this transcending land, by inspiring a quicker spirit of life and an added sensitiveness to every articulation of her frame, only gave edge to the poignancy of her grief."
1,"I contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the snowy mountains, 'the palaces of nature,' were not changed."
1,"Hours passed, while in this scene of ruin I sought for Raymond."
1,"""That country and my beloved sister are all I have."
1,"I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship."
1,"We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word ""Farewell"" It was said, and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the other was deceived; but when at morning's dawn I descended to the carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there my father again to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to renew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend."
1,But where was Perdita?
